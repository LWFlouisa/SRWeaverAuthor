      <h2>Somewhere On The Beach</h2>
<p>Becky was in the graduation hall, when she saw her old boyfriend hugging her best friend at one of the tables with food. It was the worst sort of treason. Becky walked out of the hall, pretending like he was not even in the room.</p>
<p>Becky is riding in the back seat with her sister at the wheel. Ruby’s boyfriend was in the front seat, turning on the radio to another channel during the trip. Becky was looking out the window, and she was gazing at the green mountains whizzing by through the window. She wondered what it would be like, being one of them. She would be not movable, and unable to break.</p>
<p>Becky and her sister arrived at the beach house, a late nineteenth century home who’s wood was well maintained, but there were some signs of age. They arrived in the living room, a room that was painted a lighter blue than the ocean, which was crashing along the shoe. It was thought they would have a good trip.</p>
<p>Becky, Ruby, and her boyfriend were having dinner at the large wooden table, a relatively new addition to the house, which made it feel out of place with the rest. “Becky, how do you feel about dinner?” Ruby asked. “You know it’s been my favorite since early school years.” “Yea I know,” Ruby said, trying not to snicker with disgust. “Mom always made it for us.” “You don’t like it?” “No it’s good.” Ruby’s boyfriend was looking around the house, and Ruby asked him, “Is something wrong?” “No, nothing. Something just feels out of place.” He said. “Well it’s an old house, and it does feel a little creepy.” Ruby said. Ruby was staring at her sisters shoes, and noticed she wore the same shoes she did, blue colored birkenstocks. “What’s wrong?” Becky asked. “Nothing, you copy cat.” “What did I do?” Ruby was shaking her leg like she needed to use the restroom. Her sister becky asked, “I’m not your mother, go to the restroom if you need to.” Becky began to walk up the stairs, when Ruby called, “Hey Becky?” “Make it quick please.” “Have a good stay.” “You too.”</p>
<p>Becky was in the bathroom, and was getting ready to pee. She saw a face in the window, but on closer inspection, the smoke dissipated. Becky was in her room, when Ruby knocked on the door. Becky cracked open the door of her room. “Is everything OK?” Ruby asked. “Everything is fine, what’s up?” Becky asked. “It’s nothing, I just thought I heard something.” “Maybe the boys comment is just getting to you.” “I hope its only that.”</p>
<p>That night Becky tried to sleep, but had thought about her boyfriend. She hated her best friend, and had not contacted her since that incident. She wondered if she remembers her. She tries to get back to sleep, however in the middle of the night, she felt a fist punch into her back through the bed. She woke up restless. Ruby woke up and rushed to Becky’s door, and knocked. “You OK in there?” Ruby asked in a whispering tone. “I think his comment might be getting to me to.” Becky said in a whispering tone. “I’ll talk to him. “No it’s OK,” Becky said, while putting on her nightgown. “Sorry for waking you.”</p>
<p>Becky walked into the kitchen to get a glass of water from the sink. It was when she turned on the faucet, she felt a chill. It felt like someone breathed on her neck. She turned around, and no one was there. She took her glass of water up stairs as fast as should walk. And then quickly closed the door.</p>
<p>The next morning, Ruby and her boyfriend put on their bathing suits to go swimming, and Ruby invited her to go. “Are you sure you don’t want to swim yet?” Ruby asked. “I’m going to go out in a little bit,” Becky said. “I need to take a shower, I need it.” “Try not to be to late, or the ghosts will come out.” Ruby she said jokingly. “Yea whatever.”</p>
<p>Becky was taking a shower when her shower head started to act up. The water pouring down went out suddenly, and then came out weaker and more coldly. Then everything went back to normal strength at the right temperature. Becky quickly exited the shower and put on her bathing suit to exit to the sandy beach, and on the porch she stared into the sunrise on the horizon. She walked down to the sand below, and her sister and her boyfriend were calling her to take a swim. “Come out and swim. The waters fine.” Ruby said. The boyfriend was riding a wave, and had a belly flop into the beach. It was a mouth full of sand her had to wash out. Becky went to the shore and stuck her toes in. But the water was cold. She walked in anyway.</p>
<p>Later that day, they drove into town to eat at a French restaurant. It was an informal restaurant, with casual waiters that appeared in their late twenties, wearing t shirts. Ruby’s boyfriend ordered filet mignon. Ruby ordered the same thing, while Becky ordered a merlot chicken salad. Becky was staring out the window as she took a bite. She wondered what it would be like to live her. “Hows it going Becky? Enjoying the scenery?” Ruby asked. “Maybe she’s looking for boys.” The boyfriend said. Becky stuck her tongue out at him. “I’m just wondered how much apartments cost in the area.” Ruby said. She finished a bite. “It would be nice to live somewhere for a fresh start.” “Probably outside your price range, unless you got a job here. Even then it isn’t a sure thing. It might be a while before I look for a boyfriend. I think I’m going to enjoy my youth.” “You wouldn’t have a problem finding one.” Ruby’s boyfriend said. “You say that as if you like her.” Ruby said. “Oh no, just speaking generally.” “Right.”</p>
<p>They got back to the house, and it mostly appeared as it did before. However the lamp was turned over, but it was not broken. Becky went to go prop up the lamp, and Ruby went back to her room to read a book. Becky went to go listen to her new mp3 player.</p>
<p>It was Becky’s turn to cook dinner, and she cooked hamburgers for the three of them. It was the only thing she knew how to cook at the moment. “It smells good in there.” Ruby said. “I hope it is good.” Becky said. Ruby’s boyfriend was reading a book on the couch. Becky called him over at dinner time to have his meal. “I hope we don’t have any more troubles here.” Becky asked. “Did something happen?” Ruby asked. “No, I’m just saying.” “I could go to the local library and investigate the house.” Ruby’s boyfriend said. “A waste of time, it probably wont lead anywhere.” Ruby said. “It couldn’t hurt to try.” Her boyfriend said.</p>
<p>They went into town again the next morning, and Becky split ways to go out to eat. They said they would meet back up with her in the parking lot. Becky walked into a seafood diner, and was led to the table by a young blond waiter. He had eyes matching the color of the ocean. The waiter asked her for her order. “I’ll have a tilapia.” Becky said. “Any drinks miss?” The waiter said. “Oh I’ll just have a water.” “Coming right up.&quot;</p>
<p>It was about thirty minutes before she got her food, as it was being made to order. A steaming hot plot of Tilapia topped with a fruit and tomato sauce had a smell that whiffed into her nose. She took a bite of her food, and enjoyed it. She looked out the window, and then finsihed her food.</p>
<p>Becky took her cell phone out of her purse, and called her sister. She waited for an answer, but first got an answering machine. Then Becky was called back. “Hey Becky.” “Hey, hows the research?” “We’ll tell you when we get home.” Ruby said. She put the large book back into the bookshelf.</p>
<p>Becky was leaving the diner after she payed for her meal. The waiter got her attention briefly, and asked her a question. “Hey want to go out for coffee sometime?” He asked. Becky thought it was strange someone would ask her at work, and normally she would have just rolled her eyes. She took a long hard look at him, with his wavy blond hair. “I’ll think about it.” Becky was picked up at the sidewalk of the parking lot. Ruby greeted her in the car, and the drove back to the house.</p>
<p>They arrived at the house, and things seemed to be fairly normal. Then the moon swallowed the sun. Becky was sleeping when she heard something down the hall. She went to go check it out, and she saw a black shadow walk down through the hall. Becky tried go up to it, but it dissipated into a thick black vapor merging with the night. She rushed back into her room, and slammed the door. Ruby ran to the door to check on her, and they heard a crash in the living room downstairs. The boyfriend walked downstairs to see what happened. “Alright that does it. We need to have a talk with this ghost. It’s driving out rent cost up the roof.” Ruby’s boyfriend said. “We could tell them what happened.” Ruby said. “You think they’re going to believe us?” He asked.</p>
<p>Becky was insistent that they pitch a tent or find an apartment until they had the situation sorted out. They called and hired a priest to cleanse the house. The priest walked into the house, and noticed an odd feeling when he first walked in. He felt a sense of melancholy and depression, and lots of anger. The priest took out her cell phone, and said, “I think I’m going to need a little bit of help here.”</p>
<p>Becky was sitting at a coffee shop with her new date. She stared into his eyes, and wanted to inquire about him. “So where are you going to go to colledge?” Becky asked. “I’m not even out of senior high yet.” Aaron said. “Oh! Why didn’t you tell me?” “Older girls don’t generally date younger boys.” He said with a wink. “Can’t be changed now.” “Thought you were still in high school.” “Just graduated.” “It looks like it was painful.” “I broke up with my old boyfriend.” “Was he nice?” “He was before,” Becky said. She noticed he was smiling at her. “the pricked cheated on me.” “So how’s your meal?” “It’s good.”</p>
<p>Ruby and her boyfriend went back to the house to greet the priest. The were told they needed a complete cleansing. “Before we start, I need to call my Becky.” Ruby said, to nobody in particular. She took her cellphone out of her purse, and then Becky greeted her on the other end of the phone. “Hey are you done eating yet.” Ruby asked. “About that, I’m in the hospital.” Becky said. “What!?” “I was spending time with my date. He was ran over by a car.” “Can you come over as soon as you can?” “Sure thing.” Becky was comforting her date, while she had to go back home. “The hospital is going to take good care of you.” Becky said. “Thanks for the date, it was great.” “Sure, it was fun.” “Are you going to be in town.” “I’ll take you to my tent later.” “Wait, the public beach. Isn’t that illegal?” Becky wasn’t sure what to say, she knew he would of thought she was crazy if he told her about the ghost.</p>
<p>Becky called a cab to take her home, and she gave him a tip after she exited the yellow car. The cab exited the sandy parking lot. She walked into the house. “It’s about time.” Ruby said, insensitive about the issue Becky was involved in. “We all need to hold hands together, I went ahead and poured holy water on the wooden floor.” The cleasning gave a feeling of a life from the bad aura of the house, at least for a short time. They had a good night, for a while. Then the symptoms showed up again. Ruby went ahead and extended their stay, and then called the priest. “We need help again, its starting to happen again.” “But that was the most powerful blessing we had.” They were getting ready to close up shop putting up their tent on the beach. Becky introduced her boyfriend to Ruby. “So this is your tent?” Aaron asked. “This is our tent.” “Your not suppose to do this.” “We don’t have any other choice.” “Why?” Becky told Ruby and them they were going to spend another night at the house. Ruby thought they might as well close the tent, and they spent another night. The priest called in a team of ghost investigators. “Why don’t you rent a hotel room for the night.” The priest said. “I can give you the money to rent.”</p>
<p>They got a hotel room, and things at first seemed to be fairly normal. Becky was sitting on the bed by Aaron, and they were holding hands. “Want to go out and swim with us?” “I didn’t bring my bathing suit.” “Swim in your underwear.” Becky said jokingly. However that night they began to notice similar symptoms in the hotal room. Ruby called the priest. “You gotta help us. It’s starting to happen here to.” The priest wasn’t sure whether to help them or not. The hotel room already cost him about 150 bucks. “I’ll see what I can do.” The priest said. The priest thought: Scam artists I say, scam artists. However he tuned out the unholy thought from his mind.</p>
<p>The priest arrived at the hotel, and had breakfast with the crew. Even his own faith was shaken. “If it’s true what’s going on. We are not dealing with a normal ghost.” The priest said, while taking a puff from his pipe. “But I’m started to question your honesty.” “We are just honestly curious about what’s going on?” Ruby said. “Yea me to, ma’am. Me to.” “Fine, don’t believe us.” Becky said. She already didn’t have faith anyway. It wasn’t like they asked him to pay their dingy hotel room. “The most I can say now is, our crew is going to continue to investigate. We might ask if you could stay at least another night at the beach house.” “Why?” “They say some spirits tend to move with the inhabitant.” The priest said, taking another puff. “But I need to look up what sort of ghost it is.” “The hotel manager came by and said, “Hey sir, I’m sorry but this is a no smoke suite house.” “Sorry.” The priest said, and put up his pipe. The priest bid farewell.</p>
