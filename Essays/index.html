<h2>Essays About The Comic Industry<br />And Anarchist Culture</h2>
<h2>By S.R. Weaver</h2>

<h3 id="myunresolvedfeelingsaboutculture">My Unresolved Feelings About Culture</h3>

<p>This will be about my unresolved feelings about French culture. As a background, I had considered myself having certain interests. I suppose you could say fetishes, although that might be to strong of a word. What I will say is despite this fetish, I also paradoxically grew to absolutely disdain French culture, or at least the way that I had perceived it at the time. Now I can’t even talk to a therapist without worrying about cancel culture. I would say my defining Graphic Novel, extremely personal to me, is quite literally me working through my issues about my feelings about French culture on my own.</p>

<p>I don’t even feel comfortable even calling it a Leftist Graphic Novel, although if you asked any people of a certain ilk in comics, anything that is simply about making people’s lives slightly better, is apparently what an SJW is. It was my only chance to actually resolve some personal issues I had with French culture at the time. Because I truly do not expect the left to actually be able to handle such issues in a responsible manner.</p>

<p>It all started when I met this one girl back in fifth grade: apparently the way she would communicate her attraction was by saying shit like “You’re ugly, but French people like ugly people, and I’m French-American.” I suppose it might be more accurate to say that I had issues with French-Americans. Something about moving to the US before the 21st century, and keeping the old values that French had long sense moved past. But around the same time, I was still writing on WTPD where the entire thing of that place was to allow French-Speakers to completely and thoroughly colonize their forums.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, it wasn’t even really possible to even ask for a translation, so I basically had no other choice but to learn French, despite not otherwise having this in mind. This was despite the fact that WTPD was suppose to an English-language forum. If it were the US, this would be one thing, as the US has always been a melting pot. But on a forum where the expectation that you write in English, the French seemed almost the sole exception, until other languages started showing.</p>

<p>So I resisted the idea, as long as I wrote on WTPD, that I would absolutely never learn French. It made me wonder why it was actually that the French had instruments like the guillotine, something that was originally designed as an instrument of mercy, that ended up becoming just another part of colonialism. I imagine people in places attacked by the US, that feel the same way about people that speak the English language. But this graphic novel is based on actual emotional issues that I’ve had. I don’t want the Leftists feeling like they can just push more to be more and more “revolutionary”.</p>

<p>I just want to be decent to other human beings, French or not. Even if I gradually wanted to see that culture bleed. Originally, why I wanted to create this conlang, was not having to worry about constant corrections about my bad ability to speak and write in French. I would much rather just have people not understand what I’m even saying at all, and say what’s on my mind. Seriously, Leftists, you had so much promise. Why are you worshiping the 19th century French?</p>

  
<h3 id="realismisnoendallbeall">Realism Is No End All Be All</h3>
  
<p>This essay will be about the uncanny valley effect, and why I have never previously liked Western comics in the past. Much this comes from a similar reason why I dislike increasingly realistic 3D modeling in game design, and how it has even ruined JRPGs I otherwise loved: in a sense, unlike Manga, American comics ( and multi-media more generally ) suffers from the uncanny valley effect. One thing slightly off that is unrealistic, and it ruins the entire illusion that American comics has created.</p>

<p>This is why things like Thor smashing things with his hammer, and Superman with his indestructible body and eye lasers I found so jarring: it has established itself to be the “superior” art form, despite the fact that one wrong thing can ruin the image. By contrast, Manga focuses so much on expressiveness and less on realism, that it doesn’t suffer this problem: because they never pretended to be realistic, there isn’t issues like the eyeballs rolling in the incorrect direction, and other things that ruin the illusion: specifically, that Illusion was never created to begin with.</p>

<p>Even in more realistic Manga, like Ikigami and Eternal Sabbath, there is still enough non realism--the “sketchy” look--that an eyeball slightly misaligned is not going to ruin the entire image. Although these just begin to go into what I consider “uncanny effect” for American comics.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Western Comics are largely to blame for having to much realism on their comics, so that if one thing looks slightly off, then the rest of the image looks like crap. Comic Strips also generally do not suffer from this specific problem.</p>

<p>The final issue that such overdoses on realism tends to cause, is that it creates the wrong general impression what is considered good for “entry” level manga creation, and makes people work to something that is generally impossible for beginning artists. It encourages short cuts in the creation process, like tracing Notre Dame, because they have to reach a certain “realism” quota that is simply unattainable for beginning artists. Even the people I’ve seen touting realism, generally will inconsistently apply this expectation: such as giving a pass to “male created” comics that have been grandfathered into the industry.</p>

<p>Mostly the expectation of “realism” is mainly used to harass women and other minorities creators out of the comic creation business, simply because their artistic standards isn’t necessarily the same as what is established in the Big Two in comics. They are even condescending to people who use water colors and ink washes, despite Sumi Painting being an established art form. There are even genres in fine art that play with “realism” for uncanny effects, such as by route of Magical Realism and Surrealism. There is also Cubism and Expressionism as well.</p>

<p>Realism is only one possible way to draw images, but it is far from the definitive way to draw graphic novels.</p>


<h3 id="whileimnottotallyovermanga">While I'm Not Totally Over Manga</h3>
  
<p>I wouldn’t say I’m completely over manga per say, there is still a lot of good manga that is still coming out. But the analogy I would use is someone who buys you a new meal if someone else steals one of your meals. Sure it’s fantastic you get to eat, but what you really want is that other person to stop stealing your food, so your friend doesn’t have to keep buying you new food. In a way, I’ve begun to see manga as that kind soul that keeps buying you new food, but doesn’t really stop the other person from stealing your food. In a sense, whatever way that Manga is counter-cultural, it doesn’t really fix the issues that are present in American comics.</p>

<p>At most what you might be able to say, is Manga distracts you from the issues that are apparent in American comics. But we still have a generation of people that prefers this distraction, rather than fixing the problems that attracted people like US to manga to begin with: it was a break from the environment of being talked down to as children, even though content was supposedly adult fiction. Things would be cut to off screen, despite the target audience being over the age of eighteen. I feel like Manga distracts from the issue. But there are aspects of manga ( particularly Seinin and Josie ) that I prefer over American comics here. But to me the problem isn’t necessarily to keep sending more manga, but to offer what is good about Manga in American comix: it’s able to address social issues in a way that doesn’t just further cement power in the establishment.</p>

<p>Gives American comics the tools to actually be relevant as a an additional “common language”. As it is, American comics are so stuck in the tradition of that particular industry, that they are rapidly losing relevance to people that prefer better comics that manga seems to provide: they prefer people keep buying them new sandwiches, rather than ask the person to stop stealing their food. I feel like Manga has contributed to this environment where Americans cannot even be satisfied with aspects that make American comics unique, or maintain the toxic things of the past that aren’t so much unique as annoying and unnecessary. Or excessively frivolous like super hero content. Manga took advantage of American consumers getting tired of the shit they were being offered in the US, rather than encouraging us to produce equally good content.</p>

<p>This especially effected a certain generation of consumers, between the years 2004-2007, where now books feel genuinely weird because they read left to right: in a sense we prefer reading in the direction of our economic colonizers. The Manga colonization of American comics is almost complete. What I somewhat wish is that rather than manga continuously waving false promises about Manga being a universal language, to actually help Americans produce good content here. Or at least, help Americans integrate into Japan, for those of us who don’t even relate to our own country anymore, do to the political issues that are going on here among extreme factions.</p>

<p>Manga should encourage American comic companies to stop stealing the limelight from Americans that want to actually produce something unique, that has as much relevance in American society, as Alternative Manga does in Japan, and how it came to influence and change the Manga industry. Also none of this American first sentiment, where Americans are saying Japanese people wont read our stuff. I want Japanese people to be proud to read unique American content, as a separate thing from manga. And treated as an equal contender in the marketplace of ideas, rather than relegated as second class citizens. Rather than Manga, Comics itself should be a universal language.</p>

<p>Because all sequential art is comics / manga.</p>
  

<h3 id="ontechniqueincomix">On Technique In Comix</h3>
<p>Particularly in alternative comix, a lot of the time the focus is on the specific technique, though I don’t find a lot of videos about the technique of drawing individual panels: specifically, when you’re painting calligraphy you generally wash on the entire sheet, rather than just inside of a specific panel. Because pure calligraphy is not generally split into panels. Often this means having to scan the entire sheet just to do one panel. For standard paper size, this isn’t such a big deal, but it is a problem when one of your sheets is about the size of two comic book pages put together. This is making me reconsider how I draw panels to begin with.</p>

<p>I propose a system of “hardware panels”, that is, the sheet in question is specifically folded into several panels, and then each portion of the image is scanned individually. Parts of this image are then molded into the shape of one panel in a 4-panel grid. My understanding in manga is that this is generally called aspect-by-aspect transition, however I’m not sure if they’re specifically referring to traditional calligraphy. This means modifying my entire approach to Sumi Painting, so that I’m able to fit everything all into what I have in mind. I originally planned on a four panel grid to act sort of like what they call “constrained prose / poetry” in the writing world: there is an aspect applied onto you that limits how you draw the story in question.</p>

<p>Therefore the next few pages, I’m thinking of just doing experimental art where I try different page fold size to get the right Hardware Panel form. Note however these will only be for sections where I use the constructed language to letter my graphic novel, and not necessarily for the portions where I use English or French.</p>

<p>I probably end up sticking with regular paneling for when I traditionally draw the normal parts of the graphic novel. In fact I’ve been thinking for now to focus Sumi Painting on flashback sequences for the time being.</p>

<p>Perhaps eventually I may get to the point where I can apply that technique through out the piece, and for my shorter novelettes I really don’t think that will pose as much of a problem.</p>
  

<h3 id="impossibletobeseenasanormaltranswoman">It's Impossible To Be Seen As A Normal Trans Woman</h3>
<p>Trans women and men are normal people, like every other men and women. We are not inventing new gender pronouns to prove our oppression status. I feel honestly betrayed by trans support groups, because what I associate with them now is the larger LGBT mythology invented out of whole cloth, by ideological extremists, that do not represent the best interests of trans people.</p>

<p>My lifelong goal had been to become a science fiction and fantasy writer, and to produce graphic novels. If my main character was transgendered, this meant pretty much what being transgendered has always meant: it means going to see a gender therapist, taking hormones for a certain period of time, and then having the necessary surgeries to complete your transition. But it has come to be used in ways that don’t even represent trans issues.</p>

<p>Just because I am a trans woman, does not mean that every time I create a trans character I want to depict them as having a persecution complex, and inventing new pronouns to satisfy this narcissistic tendency. You have the extreme left that are literally making us look like nothing else, and not being held accountable for this behavior.</p>

<p>You have Right-Wingers, that take this narrative and completely run with it, by constantly rebranding their own channels to fit within different narratives to perpetuate a culture war with the left. But an extremely important thing seems to be lost in this discussion: neither side represents the best interest of trans men and women.</p>

<p>Trans women / men, in almost all cases, simply want to be left alone to live their lives. Not be forced into different political ideologies, especially authoritarian ones. And now, with Anarcho-Communism becoming increasingly an oxymoron at this point, you have places like Chaz / Chop literally taking us along for that specific joy ride. A ride where you have absolute nut jobs thinking it’s OK to lecture people about mask wearing, while literally exposing yourself in public to fulfill some kind of oppression quota.</p>

<p>I don’t think that most trans support groups tolerate such political extremism, but I honestly have no idea. But there should be a new rule in trans support groups: this is not a group for preaching a political ideology, whether that is trans medicalism or trans abolitionism. Lesbians that want to debunk trans issues? Doesn’t belong in a trans support group. Lesbians who aren’t trans should not be leading any trans support group. Anarcho-communists that want to dismantle the system? Again, has no place in a trans support group.</p>

<p>The transgendered community needs to start enforcing these boundaries, as we have literally non trans people driving the public narrative about trans issues, and making it impossible to be seen as a normal Scifi and Fantasy writer, despite being a trans woman.</p>

<p>If it were a normal situation, we would be talking about how trans people can still get the medicine that we need, despite there being a pandemic. But that'ts not even being discussed, because anarchists have attempt to discredit medical science.</p>


<h3 id="theesiomimanifesto">The Esiomi Manifesto</h3>
  
<p>Is Manga a universal storytelling medium? If I am to believe the word of Silent Manga Audition, then perhaps. With all do credit, I certainly believe it’s a step above the format found in American comics, that offer overpriced sequential art on crowdfunding platforms, charging you 32 dollars for for 28 pages. Sure, while American comics may not be charging that much, the standard rate of comic books is well above the rate of inflation. At least with manga, because it is printed in black and white, it is more accessible. However there are several roadblocks that keep Manga from being even more accessible: primarily this is the barrier to entry to Shounen Jump. While it is true you can publish is various genres other than superhero content, there is an artificial barrier based on account of not being Japanese.</p>

<p>Where does this put someone who doesn’t neatly fit in a category between Western Comics and Japanese Manga? They draw in a more painterly kind of style, but still prefer to publish their work in Japanese, and publish in a language that isn’t quite French or Nihongo? I created this constructed language to account for the fact that in every single instance when I’ve tried learning a language, there is always that one person that looks down on people that don’t speak or write perfectly in that language. The solution here is obvious, because the way that you speak and write is a lot of the Japanese criteria for why someone is accepted into manga magazines, that would otherwise be a step above what is currently being published in the states.</p>

<p>This is why it is my intention to leave Western Comics and Japanese manga in my dust; I no longer feel like I need to published as a manga creator to feel as if my work has validation; my intention to create an entirely separate medium distinct from comics or manga, but still in the realm of sequential art, that has something closer to my own sensibility. This sensibility will be similar to the comic strip / yonkoma format, but with a few modification that make it more easily usable for my constructed language. This constructed language will utilize the grammar of the French language, and the vocabulary of Japanese. It will use its own distinct writing system that can be thought of as a paired down version of the Japanese language.</p>

<p>Most importantly, because it is a language that I have created, Japanese and French people have no excuse for looking down on me for not speaking their tongue in a perfect manner. I will make it easy as humanly possible to learn this distinct language.</p>

<p>I suppose you could call this a Secessionist Movement separate from corporate Manga as an institution; it will use the design sensibilities of art books in how it makes its cover art, but with the interior pages that flow more like Comic Strip Plus format, here defined as: a series of four or less panels that is drawn in a surrealistic and magical realistic fashion, that uses unconventional drawing media, such as blood, charcoal, Sumi painting, and acrylic inks. This will be told in my constructed language using a syllabic, rhyme, and metrical system distinct for this medium.</p>

<p>Most importantly, the captions will be transparent. I will primarily use black and white color, similar to manga. However the intent will be to use colors on important objects, and therefore to keep this color will be printed on higher quality paper, rather than Newsprint. Initially I may do these on Bristol board, however I may eventually find something that has characteristics of Rice Paper and Bristol Board. These will be “done in one” in 120-300 pages, rather than in a series of self-contained 22-24 page stories. More to the point, these will use poetry forms as narration.</p>

<p>See you when Uploaded Fairy is released, either on Itch ( if I decide to keep using it ), or self-published in my own studio.</p>
  

<h3 id="epirusediiesiomo">Catagories Of "Light Novels"</h3>
  
<p>There are four sets of "Light Novels" for the Hafestran language:</p>

<p>Epiruse Dii Esiomu - These light novels are generally targeted at older teenagers and young men. The plots generally revolving around the "main action" in Post Apocalyptic narratives, rather than relationships that happen behind the scenes. In general, I plan on focusing less on Esiomu type narratives.</p>

<p>Epiruse Dii Esioma - These light novels are generally targeted at older teenagers to young women, and revolve around the romantic relationships in apocalyptic scenarios. My approach with Esiomi will primarily focus on these sorts of plot lines, with occassional dips into Epiruse Dii Esiomu.</p>

<p>Epiruse Dii Esiomo - These are two cross gender Post Apocalyptic books, that focus on every aspect of the Post Apocalyptic world of French and Japanese speaking portions of the United States. I consider my first Light Novel to be Epiruse Dii Esiomo. Within its own continuity, Epiruse Dii Esiomo can lean toward Esiomu or Esioma.</p>

<p>Eventually I will be switching to using these catagories when marketing my work, making the system I use distinct from the catagories used in Manga Magazines, along with using a picto-syllabic language that is left to right, even though these will still be drawn right to left in graphic novel form.</p>


<h3 id="musicchanges">Music Taste Changes As You Get Older</h3>
<p>Music is one of those things that tends to change as you become older: initially I burnt myself on country music, and this was before I realize that it had a conservative political slant ( conservative in a before 2016 sense ). So I had avoided anything folksy of all kinds mostly because what I tended to associate with folk music was bad southern accents, and people whining about shit I didn’t care about.</p>

<p>Yet now as I get older, I’m increasingly growing a preference for some forms of traditional music, although it should be noted that this tends to be music not in the English language. I tend to associate English with crudeness, and in some cases doesn’t use music to the best of its abilities. In general, I prefer the sound of such music in languages like French and Portuguese, do to the fact that languages other than English ( and maybe Germanic languages as well ) tend to be syllabic timed.</p>

<p>Probably my favorite Portuguese music artist is Roberto Leal, although that may just be because I don’t understand the Portuguese language real well, but there certainly isn’t a Southern American accent. And there is nothing worse than a Southern conservative. But the melody itself is extremely addicting. I had even eluded to my parents how if you took away the lyrics in country, it would almost be tolerable.</p>

<p>Simply put, to me English to me sounds like grunting. It’s the language that cavemen speak when they don’t have a more polite way of communicating their message. Even French sometimes sounds comparatively crude compared to the Portuguese language, although in every day parlance it does sound exactly as French tend to be stereotyped: sexy, witty, partying. It’s a language of some beautiful woman going down on you.</p>

<p>These days I have largely gotten over my issues with French people, after learning their language. But I still don’t care for country music specifically. But I absolutely love certain kinds of traditional music, in syllabic timed rhythm, with some dances.</p>
  

<h3 id="inanimesequence">In Anime Sequence</h3>
<p>This essay is about the building resentment I’ve been having toward manga, that has been slowly building every sense Tokyopop and Ink Blazers gave me the wrong impression of how easy it is to get into the Manga industry in Japan. I feel like I spent a lot of years as a novelist, visualizing the scenes that I would write in anime sequences in my head, under this idea that maybe someday I could be published in Shounen Jump, and eventually Young Jump. Although now the own quality manga scenes these days seem to be Josie magazines. At least for now such magazines have not be effected by American politics, but the barrier to entry is still even worse than in Silent Manga Audition.</p>

<p>Manga could have branded itself right off the bat as this thing where now Gaijin could possibly ever have any real hope of being published in any of their books, and perhaps I wouldn’t have gravitated to Manga quite as much as I did. To think that at one point I had considered Manga as a panacea to the problems that seemed inherent in American animation and comics. While it’s certainly true that this would not be noticed by people that only read manga, it sticks out like a sour thumb that want to create it. And now I almost feel ready to completely repudiate both American and Japanese comics. And perhaps even French comics, if the barrier to entry is even worse.</p>

<p>We need a system in place where we don’t really need American, French, and Japanese comic publishers to feel validated as sequential art creators, even if that means operating on largely an individual basis that is most conducive for branding ourselves as LGBT persons. I genuinely don’t see real reforms actually happening in either American, French, or Japanese comics. Especially for LGBT people who have not bought into Critical Theories, or believe that gender is a social construct. It doesn’t help that Comicsgate highlights the general right-wing slant that seems inherent in American comics.</p>

<p>Ink Blazers could have been a great thing, at least for the length of time that I didn’t know how to make my own website. But now publishing my writing on Wattpad, and trying out places like Tapas out seems largely like a waste of time to me. Because the real issue is not completely throwing the baby out with the bath water when it comes to who gets to be published, but route of websites like Pixiv, with website bugs that take longer than they should to be fixed. But by having an actual viable editorial standards that is inclusive in LGBT in the right way, and not through the lens of Critical Theory. And also inclusive of Gaijins that wants to learn Japanese, and have equal access to the publishing world as anyone native to that country.</p>

<p>If this issue were fixed, I would already move. As the United States is absolutely dead to me as a Leftist that simply wants to go Deep Stealth with her gender transition. And also blend in with Japanese natives, and could learn the language to relative proficiency. In a sense though, no matter what I do, I will always be seen as “that fake mangaka” because my native language is not Japanese. So I’m stuck in a state where I have no patriotism to American Comics, and would rather go my own way from Manga.</p>

<p>I no longer dream in anime sequence.</p>
  

<h3 id="esoupediiemiro">Esoupe Dii Emiro: A Sub-Set Of Ero-Guro</h3>
<p>Traditionally ero-guro is meant to have a weird sense of eroticness, and a grotesque element. However much of mine is going in a slightly different direction from the genres roots: in general, mine tends to focus on romantic couples. The focus is primarily on the grotesque aspect, and less so on the erotic aspect. To this extent, Esoupe Dii Emiro is more horror-oriented despite having its origins in gothic romance to some degree. That's not to say romantic elements wont be present. For specifics:</p>

<p>Esoupe Dii Emiro is derived from Couple and the word for death in French. Themes often revolve around "Reve De Repos" or dreams of death, and less so on actual deaths that happen as the story progresses. Generally such dreams revolve around time travel, and perilous situations that threaten the metaphysical demise of the main character, but also some dreams can also bleed into the real world, such as in the second of my book Uploaded Fairy.</p>

<p>In specifics, rather than a romance slowly being established, Esoupe Dii Emiro establishes a relationship from the get go, and the romantic pairing slowly breaks apart. Generally by the end of the story, the couple either dies together or one is left alone in the world to fend off forces that seek vengence of the death of one's lover. In this sense it break from the romantic tradition by not having a HEA type ending, but does not go head long into horror territory.</p>

<p>The idea for the term Esoupe Dii Emiro came from wanting to write about "beutiful death" or the romanticization of couples that are doomed to seperate over a course of severe strain on their relationship. How this will evolve into something seperate from Eru-Guro Nansensu, I'm not quite sure yet.</p>
  

<h3 id="distancingmyselffromcyberpunk">Distancing Myself From Cyberpunk: Staying True To Source</h3>
<p>This is about my general dissatisfaction with the Cyberpunk genre. I gravitated to Cyberpunk fiction because it was something different than Superhero content. It was a genre that focused on the gritty aspect of science fiction future in a way that didn’t revolve around Totalitarian States, and more that technology was ugly because people were ugly. However, what has happened with the genre is authors eager to snatch a few extra bucks, has turned it into a trend rather than an essay about how society has gone wrong. You even have comic creators inserting things that were never intended as a part of cyberpunk; things generally confined to Super Hero stories. While it’s true that super heroes don’t have to be like the Adam West cartoon, the point is Cyberpunk was never intended as a thing for corporate cash grabs.</p>

<p>However, when you mention wanting to create your own science-fiction genre, you’re often met with a juvenile level of resistance, especially on social media platforms like Twitter, where people confuse Anarcho-Communism with Cyberpunk protagonists, despite the protagonists in such stories being the entire opposite of Altruistic; they only care about themselves, and Cyberpunk stories were intended as a warning. Not a future that is to be desired, by people that want to make a quick buck.</p>

<p>However, the thing about people creating niche genres and short stories, is their goals isn’t necessarily the same thing as Corporate Publishers. Their goal isn’t necessarily even the same as being Anarcho-communist, although there are people that would try to ape Cyberpunk stories to fit with their ideological narratives.</p>

<p>I have absolutely no reason not to diverge from the genre and trope expectations of Cyberpunk fiction. The more I write, the least interested I am in pulp fiction type narratives, and more interested in exploring the inner depths of someone’s psychosis and mental health issues. Originally Cyberpunk was also about this: it sure as well wasn’t about misplaced altruism, and people lording it over people with “Sensitivity Readers”--an idea I find completely abhorrent as someone who is a minority myself: I am a trans woman. I don’t need someone else telling me what I should change or not change based on whether it might offend trans women. I’m the best judge for that sort of thing.</p>

<p>In practice, people are misusing the Cyberpunk genre to basically push their own personal narratives on other people, not explore dystopian societies in futures that either “cannot exist”--the opportunity for that future to happen has long sense past, or society has become even more dystopian sense Cyberpunk fiction was first created: Cyberpunk didn’t anticipate that youtube would be injected people with political ideologies by route of cults like Breadtube and the Alt-Right. It predicted electronic cults to some degree. But certainly not extreme right-wing or left-wing ideological currents.</p>

<p>I want to write my own dark vision of the future, separate and distinct from Cyberpunk: one that focuses on my own fears about increasingly mechanized and virtual reality driven societies. I had been going in the direction of exploring my own version of “dream space”, however this was aped from me by lesser graphic novel creators. So having to start from the ground up, and basically come up with my own virtual reality system ... again.</p>

<p>My future is born, your future is Cyberpunk.</p>

<p>And we irreparably different. In sort, Cyberpunk has lost what was “punk” about it, and replaced it with being “trendy”. Which is completely counter to the entire point of the genre. It has also been irreparably inflected with people’s ideologies rather than the source material.</p>
  

<h3 id="theauthoritarianleftascomicscensorshipbody">The Authoritarian Left As Comics Censorship Body</h3>
<p>﻿Is the Radical Left hijacking the comics industry, or is it the opposite? The truth is, as much as Comicsgate and Progressives in comics don’t want to admit this, the truth is somewhere in the middle: it is true that comics has always been way more Progressive than Comicsgate types give the medium credit for; however there is also a movement within comics to try to make previously Conservative comics politically into something political: Archie Comics, one of the last people to abandon the Comics Code Authority, comes to mind specifically.</p>

<p>The greater issue to me is the fact that people that didn’t use to write for the comics, are hijacking publishers with different sensibilities, and turning into something that revolves around Critical Theories. In a sense, by making Archie comics progressives, what they are actually doing in essence, and making the one comic that served as a testament to how bad comics were in terms of conservative politics, and making it look like comics were always progressive. When the reality is this is simply not the case. Marvel Comics was always progressive, absolutely, but not Archie comics. It completely eliminates Archie comics as a point in comparison to how comics could stand to improve, by becoming more left leaning. And this narrative is always an Authoritarian leftist one, and not a Libertarian Leftist perspective.</p>

<p>The fundamental difference between Libertarian Leftist, and Authoritarian Leftists, is a greater respect for freedom of speech in proportion to other freedom more respected by those on the right of the political spectrum, including individual liberties. Conservative political need to still exist, in order to serve as a point of comparison to how bad American comics used to be in terms of censorship. I can’t help but feel like if progressives in comics had their way, they would eliminate all evidence that the Comics Code Authority ever happened; and the primarily reason that  they would want to do this, is because they want to apply their own form of Left-Wing censorship to the sequential art medium.</p>

<p>But here is the problem: Comicsgate and other movements also want to engage in their own form of censorship, by rolling back the comics industry back to the late 1950s. It’s perfectly possible to have both left-wing style censorship and right-wing style censorship of media and history. This is also way we need to not rely so much as Mainstream comics being the primarily bastion of Left-Wing values, particularly of a Libertarian Leftist direction. Unfortunately, switching from Magazine format from Comics format is no longer relevant, as most media are largely electronic on form.</p>

<p>But this means alternative methods of evading censorship, using decentralized technologies like the fediverse to host web comics. I was researching the history of Left-Wing magazines, and despite what authoritarian leftists will tell you, the Soviet Union actually engaged in some of the worst forms of Totalitarian suppression of sequential art. Ideally people would be hosting their own instances, rather than relying on a fediverse blog like write as or plume to protect their rights as creators. As much of censorship doesn’t strictly have to come from a Statist apparatus. It can also come from individuals who are compromised by political idealogies like critical theory, which can either be private business people ( right-wing ) or public service ( left-wing ) people. Neither the government or private enterprise has had a very good history of being against censorship of sequential art, with MAD and The Realist being exceptions.</p>

<p>We deserve better than compromised publishers. In fact, the one thing you can rely on with the authoritarian left is an equal tendency to suppress those that want a stateless society.</p>
  

<h3 id="hiddenglasscieling">The Hidden Glass Cieling Of Being A Gaijin, And Anarcho-Transhumanism In An Anarcho-Communist Culture</h3>
<p><i>This is the original uncensored version of my essay, where I specifically call out and critique Anarcho-Communism, and how it may not reflect how Anarchists really feel about issues like Trans Issues. Critical Theory is slowly infecting some portions of Left-Wing spaces, which is the real reason I want to leave the US.</i></p>
  
<p>Typically when we think of injustice, what immediately comes to mind is explicit biases like racism, transphobia, etc. However, while these glass ceilings still very much exist in modern America, it is fair to say they are more subtle for people who feel they have fallen into a category of outsiders—a status that is less easily defined. For example, I consider myself a transwoman. I also have a sexual preference that only very recently had a name for it. While homosexuality and trans issues have progressed over the years, as they should, people who prefer the company of robots and sex dolls still have a hard time.</p>

<p>In general, minorities in the realm of romance have had to contend with being compared with crimes against young people, whether that’s homosexuality, bisexuality, or whatever. Because sex dolls and robots have not yet reached a level of sentience, there is still this idea that you’re essentially doing something vile, to what is basically—for the moment—a sex toy. And this excludes the fact that many like us may or may not even be sexual. Even though, it is not specifically asexuality, there is a preference for girls with mechanical parts and being completely robotic in nature. We see this in early films like Metropolis, but there are a few plots in science fiction where people have developed romantic attachments to our robotic brothers.</p>

<p>We’re reaching an interesting point in history where the technology in sex robots is becoming increasingly lifelike. Some of my favorite Manga over the years have explored such things, like Chobitz. There is still the fact that I have never felt I belonged in the United States, besides being born here. I had largely ignored this aspect, and delayed learning other languages like French and Japanese for a long time. However, this brings me to the point where I must talk about this subtle kind of ceiling that has never been discussed in the US—one that Japanese language students experience by nature of not being Japanese. This causes problems for people who want to enter the Japanese work force. Yet I may have no other option if political events keep going in the direction they are. Going forward, I will be discussing Gaijin, a class of people either traveling to Japan, or who are expats living there, seeking to learn Japanese in order to integrate into Japanese society.</p>

<p>The manga industry, more generally, has had trouble accepting foreigners into the industry. Preferring robotic girls, however, is more manageable than simply never being able to find work in Japan. I used to like the idea of working in Japan, largely because I thought it would be fun. And that would finance my interest in furthering the advancement of robotic technology of which I think will further erode the dividing line between robots and humans.</p>

<p>Another worrisome aspect in human interaction is the growing fear of civil war in the US. Many think this reality is no longer far-fetched. In fact, we’ve had a silent cold civil war for many years ever since the election of Donald Trump. To make matters worse, contrary to what you might think, anarcho-communism has actually made it harder for me to come out as someone with an alternative sexuality. Unlike the anarcho-communist who support Trump, not everyone who is a minority wants to dismantle the system. Anarcho-communists like to think they're the only valid form of left-wing anarchism, yet this places a damper on free speech and talking about alternative economic and social approaches. But most importantly, Transhumanist and Mutualists don't hate Asian people in the same way Anarcho-Communists, and communism more generally does.</p>

<p>Here, I have no trust in any new system that will evolve in the near future to specifically cater to people like myself, whose outsider status has less to do with economics, and more with preferring other cultures like Manga and Otaku culture. Perhaps one could blame Japanese soft power for misinforming or miseducating others about our preferences, and that has produced a generation of American youth who don’t really feel like they belong anywhere else. This fact constitutes a major hindrance when it comes to most graphic novel publishing houses (other than manga) accepting books in right to left format–which, for us, is how we are used to reading content.</p>

<p>The period between 2004-2007 was an interesting time for Manga production in the US. Despite the overtures of diversity being made at larger presses, we still must turn our panels to a different direction. I feel like, in a way, I would rather pursue my passions learning Japanese, living among others in this same predicament in another country. I would try to get published over there, rather than receiving the worst form of disrespect here from anarchist circles, who misguidedly make transwomen and other minorities look insane. In doing so, they think they will somehow win support among the people that stormed Washington.</p>

<p>I don’t want to live in a country where I feel I don’t really belong because of my different left-wing Anarchist idealogy, which is neither about Critical Theory or Breadlines. I feel like an outsider in my own country. In many ways, this status has helped me in my passion to write science fiction from the standpoint of an outsider.</p>

<p>In many of my fiction writings over the years, a majority of my main characters have actually been transwomen, with the exception of their various lovers. I have also developed an alternative future, where the US primarily speaks French, Japanese, and a fusion language between the two. France and Japan would come in and take over a hallowed-out country from the remains of what was once the United States.</p>

<p>In this fictional narrative, figures like Marine Le Pen from the far-right party of France would not be allowed to rule the French portion of North America. The rise of populism in the global stage constitutes a menace for humanity. But if a concerted effort is done among nations of the planet, transcending race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious belief, our global village not only will survive, but also thrive.</p>

<p>Again, I want to live in a country where I feel I belong. I may not get all I want, but an eventual atmosphere like this would make me feel less like an outsider. An inclusive society is what I hope for. However, introducing policies with malicious intents to marginalize LGBT individuals and other minorities will undoubtedly exacerbate an already polarizing society. And the people that claim to advocate for us may not be the most representative of what the majority of anarchists feel.</p>

<p>As an aside, you'll notice how this one Magazine editor called me him in my autobiography. Which is another indicator that Communists are actually not as Left-Wing as you might think.</p>
  

<h3 id="howprogressivesenablethefarright">How Progressive Networks Enable The Far Right</h3>
<p>I used to think I was more likely to get the actual news watching Progressive channels on youtube, or at least more accurately than right-wing channels. And yet more and more what I’ve begun to notice is outright exclusive of certain news stories if it doesn’t fit their narrative. Myanmar is one case in point. If I did not watch CNN, MSNBC, and other channels, I probably would never have heard that Myanmar is erupting into civil war. This seems like a major story to exclude on progressive networks. While it’s true Progressives don’t outright condone what is happening in Myanmar, excluding the story from your line up can effectively be the same thing.</p>

<p>But to me this represents a larger trend on how the progressive message isn’t quite as left-wing I used to think it was. In fact, I’m beginning to feel like the way progressive channels discuss the news, is actually what enables the disgusting behaviour of the far right. To me the only right difference between the authoritarian left and authoritarian right, is the left generally excludes important information, but the far right includes stories and offers an explicitly mean spirited hot take. But morally, when it’s the difference between knowing what your nation is doing overseas, and living in blissful ignorance, this is effectively morally the same thing.</p>

<p>Which is a really weird thing to realize: Progressive news tends to gaslight its base into thinking that only it has the right facts and information. To think that I used to believe that Progressive news was largely immune to the partisan division that tends to plague the mainstream parties. Plus when you analyze what your nation is doing overseas, it lends credence to the idea that simply reforming the state wont end the endless wars overseas. That’s not to say some of the things progressive networks advocate are not worthy goals, however simply making the state more live able isn’t good enough if that simply maintains a Fascist politically establishment, that doesn’t care what America’s reputation in the Middle East and Asia.</p>

<p>And yet the problem is I’ve also lost faith in Breadtube, which more often than not seems to prefer making compromises with the Marxist-Leninist camp, as referenced on C4SS. And yet it was mainly the left wing that was convincing me I should use Creative-Commons rather than traditional copy write law. Sure a stateless society is more ideal, however how am I suppose to take a political side seriously that on one hand: says that copyright law is inherently invalid, and yet on the other hand kisses up to the establishment that does things like deliberately exclude important news information, like the civil war that is about to erupt over in Myanmar.</p>

<p>This is why we need to not demonize people that want to get their news from all sorts of difference sources, as the reality is Progressive news is no more invested in giving you accurate information on world affairs, as any other partisan network. And if this is the people that are trying to say that copyright law is invalid, then I’m completely unconvinced.</p>
  

<h3 id="authorsjobisnottodebatetheirreaders">An Authors Job Is Not To Debate Their Readers</h3>
<p>﻿There is a fundamental problem with the idea that everything someone creates and produces is up for debate. It would be one thing if someone were a Green Party member wanting to run for local public office. But when it comes to Marxist-Leninist, more often it is being used to suppress dissenting opinions, in contrast to their stated goals. For example, if I wrote a blog post, in some people’s minds I’m suppose to permit that comment poster to voice the opinion. The Alt-Right has frequently taken advantage of this situation, but developing methods to send Leftists down Alt-Right language rabbit holes. But it fails to make a distinction between the artist and creative, whose sole profession is to entertain and “educate” in a literary sense of the term, and a public official whose job is to win public support in a democratic framework.</p>

<p>In my experience with Breadtube specifically, it was not possible to write about any opinion that I had, regardless of how sensational it wasn’t. They were always pressuring to become more and more far left, despite myself being largely satisfied with the current viewpoints that I have. This one person in particular, made it seem like I was obligated to let him debate my personal essays, even if the intended goal was not necessarily to convince others of my view of reality, but rather to present my own view of reality in as concise and entertaining a manner as possible: that is, to entertain. Not present an opinion in a debate. Not persuade him of a position.</p>

<p>Frequently how it ends up working out, more “radical”--whether these views are actually radical or just royally authoritarian is one thing that could be debated, so people who have less mental energy than other people end up getting taken advantage of by people who may not have facts on their side ( just exchange God with facts, in the case of the Far Left ) but are able to argue it in a loud and energetic fashion. Making it look like those with the loudest opinions are the most representative.</p>

<p>Often this manifests in the way they permit cis white men to control the narrative of the discussion of trans issues, and make it look like gender dysphoria is not centered on dysphoria despite it literally being in the diagnostic criteria and the majority are not born as transsexual. This has created the current Far Right environment, where the far left takes upon themselves the image that Right Wingers stereotype us with, as the way that left wingers are.</p>

<p>Just because someone places a blog post on their website, does not mean that everything someone posts is up for debate. And more and more, despite the far left claiming only the Far Right has a Ship Of Theseus problem, the extreme left also has   pipelines of their own, that permit these Marxist-Leninist folk to control the scope of debate while claiming to support open debate.</p>

<p>Authors are not public figures. We don’t write personal stories to be debated. Its sole purpose is to entertain.</p>
  

<h3 id="shoefetishesarenotfootfetishes">Shoe Fetishes Are Not Foot Fetishes</h3>
<p>﻿Contrary to what some might tell you, fetishes don’t necessarily control your life. There are people we probably live with whom we may never guess have certain kinds of kinks. For myself, I’ve have two ( and possibly three ) different types of shoe fetishes for much of life: I really love a petite woman in a pair of Dutch, French, Alsatian, Belgian wooden clogs. Recently I have also started getting into the German design. Although the reasons for this interest differ from why people tend to be into people in high heels. I also have an artist in what we think of as “clogs”, and Birkenstock: particularly Arizona and Boston style. I love it when they’re barefoot.  It reminds me of corrupting angels.</p>

<p>In fact, it’s the opposite. The fact that’s not generally thought of as being sexual is what makes it so sexy. A little like having why some like converting Fundamentalist Christians to Satanism. It’s the process of corruption that is erotic. However, there are a couple of things shoe fetishes are not: I don’t have a “foot fetish”. And I don’t have a “Stocking fetish”. In the fetish world, people know not to confuse these things, but such knowledge is less common outside of such spaces.</p>

<p>It’s important to remember that someone can have both a shoe fetish and a foot fetish, but one can easily have a shoe fetish and not a foot fetish. For example, until recently ( and still some degree ) I find feet to actually be rather repulsive. And it gets worse the older the person gets, especially if they don’t take care of them self. My interest is exclusively in cute girls wearing wooden shoes, clogs, and birkenstocks.</p>

<p>This is one of the main reasons I haven’t specifically hired an artist for my graphic novels; my preference, because I’m very particular about my taste, is that I draw it myself. And I very much doubt there is very many shoe fetishes in the graphic novel and comic script community. There might be more than I might think. Even in Manga, usually the only place you’re going to find shoe fetish porn is in off the beaten path websites like Deviantart. You’re certainly not going to find shoe fetish content in Shounen Jump. You might find foot fetish porn in Young Jump magazine.</p>

<p>But apparently shoe fetish interests are rare enough, that apparently people have a tendency to confuse shoe fetishes with foot fetishes, which is apparently much more common. So in case you want to talk to me about my shoe fetish, please remember not to confuse it for any other fetish, and this can be somewhat offensive, and indicates not really being informed. It’s caused a lot of issues, as I tend to be secretive about my interests, as it’s not something to talk about in polite company. My ex room mate, against my wishes, would reveal to the world what my interest in shoes were for the purposes if trying to control me.</p>

<p>It must be emphasized to that such things are not OK, not matter how weird thing think someone’s interests might be. And yet on Twitter, specifically, you’ll have people discuss BDSM all the time. Despite BDSM being a much weird kink than shoe fetishes ever will be.</p>
  

<h3 id="myrealissuewithamericanpublishers">My Real Issue With Amerimanga Publishers</h3>

<p>If your first impression of counter-cultural elements in comics were comicsgate, you might be led to believe that the only issue ( if it is even an issue ) with mainstream comics is diverse representation. But in reality, the precise issue with comics is the exact opposite: when mainstream publishers do represent Trans issues, it is always in an incorrect manner, similar to the way Breadtube depicts us Trans women.</p>

<p>So actual issues about a medium that comicsgators seem to worship often gets unecessessarily ignored on on youtube, with the fight being unfairly represents as being about whether diversity is a good thing or a bad thing. But my issue with Manga, is more specific: to me it is about to the way Tokyopop handles their line up, yes. But not do to diversity. Rather sleazy things that go unnoticed:</p>

<p>I have to play a drinking game, whenever Tokyopop does something like: present “audio manga”, which are basically just audio books with manga in the name. If it were an audio rendition of a light novel, this would be one thing. But they're calling it “audio manga”. The very definition of manga is that of sequential visual art.</p>

<p>You don't need to redefine words, when it's perfectly fine to coin new words that function for the same purpose. And yet little sleazy business decisions is not what's being complained about by pro vs. anti-comicsgate on twitter: they're still debating yay or nay diversity.</p>

<p>And this plays into also how Amerimanga has treated Manga as a visual art medium in general: the only person I ever meet that say things like “Japanese manga doesn't open itself up to foreign creators” are precisely members of the alt-right, that want to keep American creators in America. They might not be knowingly playing into that tendency by calling something “audio manga”, but it indicates an ignorance about what makes manga the manga medium.</p>

<p>I've never seen a publisher that disrespects the medium of manga as much as Tokyopop does. This is one of the reasons I fucking done with Amerimanga as a thing. I'll be shifting in the direction of bringing Nouvelle Gekiga back to its roots: Something that was always intended to be Manga in the French language. And eventually, into a language onto itself.</p>

<p>Amerimanga companies would rather redefine the word manga to stay “on brand”, rather than admit to create an entire generation where American comics does not feel like their home, and facing the reality awakening that, until recently, Manga publishers don't want American creators.</p>

<p>And yet what just happened in manga? Suddenly Shounen Jump is starting to accept manga creators. You know why this is right? It's not diversity: Manga companies are more willing to adjust to changes in the social climate. But they don't redefine the word manga.</p>

<p>And I wont either, I will use a new word for what I do.</p>
  

<h3 id="culturalrevolutionsoftenexcludesmallerchanges">Cultural Revolutions Often Exclude Smaller Changes</h3>

<p>For those who grew up in certain areas of the United States, it's common knowledge at this point that there are several pocket communities of people that speak other languages besides English. Le Etats-Unis is most definitively not a monolingual "country", despite how Europe might think of us. And this is thanks in part to our history of welcoming European immigrants, and several from different parts of Asia and Asia Minor.</p>

<p>But these days political changes have been happening in the comic book and graphic novel community, that make it harder for those from immigrant backgrounds to read naturally, despite the US otherwise pretending to welcome immigrants, who are already having a harder time thank in no small part to the political changes happening do to the previous Trump regime, and possibly even future presidents that push the Fascist envelope.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, even the left is resistant to people producing graphic novels in reading orders other than in left-to-right, then top-to-bottom. Rather than top-to-bottom, then left-to-right. This is despite the fact that many Asian languages have alternative reading orders besides the reading other that is default for most Germanic and Romance languages.</p>

<p>Reading order of material isn't some magical exception, where people whom should be welcoming of minorities, somehow get a free pass on the language department. It's not supportive of minorities to also demand they only produce content in English, in European language reading order. And yet some of the loudest vioces on youtube unironically claim that producing "Amerimanga" is somehow cultural appropriation.</p>

<p>This is despite that fact that anyone actually in the communities that would be reading material in the Japanese language, would be such people from said backgrounds, whom would be used to alternative reading order patterns. In this way, the cultural revolutionaries have forgotten the most important way in which you can most accomidate imigrant reading communities:</p>

<p>Producing content in the natural reading order of that language. This was excluding, despite all this talk about systemic issues: maybe because they don't think of demanding English-only content as being descriminatory. But I'm not going to adjust what I do to accomodate people who only want Sequential Art in English.</p>
  

<h3 id="productivityandserialformat">Productivity And Serial Format</h3>

<p>In the novel writing world, they have sense moved on from the serial format, because of the general productivity issues that tend to come from producing things for serialization. It's also why I've never agreed to produce things based on a deadline, because it makes most normal people crack under pressure than keep producing content.</p>

<p>And yet for some reason, there is a certain demographic in comics, that want to keep interupting people's thought streams on twitter, to lectur them about how they're SJWs ruining the comics scene: this is despite producing graphic novels rather than serial installments. Could you imagine if you produced a book of essays this way:</p>

<p>You wake up every morning trying to get a 500-700 word essay done, and then you have some asshole on twitter spewing and throwing insults at you, and then gaslighting you by making themselves look like the customer whom should be treated as your King. You're a left-wing essay creator, and but you can ever actually finish this boo, because you have to submit each essay for the approval of some some asshole whom doesn't even read left-wing essays to begin with. And somehow that right-winger is the only one qualified to offer comments and suggestions, even if they are never framed as comments and suggestions.</p>

<p>And yet, this had been how things have worked on the creativity end of the comics community in the US. You can not simply be left alone to create for one one second on Twitter. And yet these are the same people also blaming people for not churning out content fast enough. I wonder why that could be? Maybe it's because you're constantly spewing insults at people.</p>

<p>In the real world, the way it works is this: you outline a story, you finish a draft of a story, then you revise / edit as much as you need to to polish it. Then you finally submit to your editor a complete work of prose. This is how things should work in comics. You never get anything done trying to produce serial content in this environment, especially when you have reactionaries constant screaming and victim-blaming at you on social media.</p>

<p>It's long past the time when Graphic Novels and other kinds of longform content have become the norm. The only way that I can get anything done is to produce a 54,000 word novel, turn that into a script, and then draw it. A few months ago I was even having to wait for an artist. When I don't have a lot of free time as it is to sit on my ass, and wait for someone to offer. Yet these same people will also blame you for producing entirely your own content.</p>

<p>This is why I ultimately opted to self-publish my graphic novel on Itchio, and these will not be produced by the process of serial content.</p>
  

<h3 id="understandingrobosexualityandtechnofetishism">Understanding Robosexuality And Technofetishism</h3>

<p>If you were to read the currently available resources on robosexuality and technofetishism, you would be led to believe that people that consider themselves such have serious control issues. It’s not even universally true that were into BDSM, although in my case I do like girls in pillories and wooden shoes. Most accurately it manifests similarly to asexuality, but with a major difference: robosexual people are not so much asexual, as they have an exclusive preference for human shaped mechanical parts, or in some variations images or holograms of girls. The current sex doll phenominon is one variation of it.</p>

<p>Despite some of the fear mongering of it, this isn’t going to replace Breeders, or those who exclusively prefer sexual interactions with people made out of flesh. Nor are some of the nightmarish analogies presented by firms like Singularity Net necessarily accurate: it’s perfectly possible to be Robosexual, and not necessarily be Transhumanist. Although I do have some transhumanist interests. Rather we find that the sensation of human flesh be largely unappealing, although this can come with its own varieties.</p>

<p>For example, I like both girls made out of meat and girls made of flesh. I prefer robots and cyborgs with a certain degree on personal autonomy, and isn’t any different from interacting with people made out of flesh. Sometimes they do come in the form of mind uploads, although they can also be true artificial intelligence as well: forms of intelligence created completely in MIT and IT labs, that have no human components what so ever.</p>

<p>There is an entire genre of manga, devoted exclusively to people who prefer some variation of technofetishism: for a lot of us, such movies allow us to fulfill desires that are not yet possible do to Artificial Intelligence still currently being to primitive. I say this as someone with an interest in develop humanoid robots who are indistinguishable from people. The problem with stuff like Alita Army, is that it completely ignores crucial reasons why people like anime like Battle Angel Alita, Saikano, Ghost In The Shell, and Chobitz.</p>

<p>Eventually I’m going to check out Mardock Scramble. The most important thing is that Robosexuality is a fetish and not an orientation, and it also doesn’t make people bad for having this fetish, but we’re not necessarily about control issues. Mechanical parts and holograms is our kink.</p>
