<h2>A Curation Of Poetry</h2>

<h2>Atomic Roach</h2>
<p>Opening the door,<br />
The water begins to leak.<br />
Roaches flow out<br />
one by one, mind games<br />
they play with humans. Giant</p>
<p>Atomic roaches<br />
flow out one by one<br />
to big for swatting.<br />
one by one, mind games<br />
they play with humans. Giant</p>
<p>Atomic roaches,<br />
you better block the hose,<br />
close that sucker shut.</p>
<p>Before the roach becomes<br />
Your bride and groom.<br />
When humanity is doomed.</p>
<p>Beware the Atomic Roach.</p>

<h2>Beauty In Imperfection</h2>
<p>Wabi sabi.<br />
Beauty in the imperfection.<br />
Wabi sabi.<br />
Like morning rain with yellow red.<br />
The rain clouds rise overhead<br />
and drench the crimson raincoats.<br />
Wabi sabi.</p>
<p>La vie in rose.<br />
With all its tragic flaws...<br />
Midnight comes soon.</p>
<p>CHORUS<br />
Dont forget to live<br />
with all lifes quirks,<br />
the rain roses grass.</p>
<p>With crimson raincoats<br />
it covers up the blood<br />
and sops up the rain.</p>
<p>Wabi sabi.<br />
Beauty in the imperfection.<br />
Wabi sabi.<br />
Like morning rain with yellow red.<br />
The rain clouds rise overhead<br />
and drench the crimson raincoats.<br />
Wabi sabi.</p>
<p>CHORUS<br />
Perhaps the rain will<br />
wash away the blood and tears.</p>

<h2>Broken Angel</h2>
<h3>Beneath A Pile Of Ash</h3>
<p>In the past I slept<br />
between the tent and the trees.<br />
Yet now I wander.</p>
<p>Long ago, from grass to<br />
river I sip wine.<br />
Yet not its dirty<br />
water from the grave.<br />
To not drink is brave.</p>
<p>In the past I slept<br />
between the tent and the trees.<br />
Yet now I wander.</p>
<p>I now wake up,<br />
another eon has passed.<br />
All the people see<br />
an angel in the farmyard.<br />
And yet secrets hide.</p>
<p>In the past I slept<br />
between the tent and the trees.<br />
Yet now I wander.</p>
<p>It takes one sin<br />
To take my life away.<br />
And yet it's you<br />
Who sees no demon,<br />
Under the skin of flames.</p>
<p>But a broken angel,<br />
Hidden beneath a pile of ash.</p>

<h2>Circus Of Cybernetics</h2>
<p>Once upon a<br />
a midnight dream I witness<br />
trophy heads upon<br />
a wall at cozy circus.<br />
But without clowns of blood.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you help us find our bodies,<br />
Or do you think we're nobodies?&quot;,<br />
they say, beckoning me forth.</p>
<p>In this cozy circus<br />
there were cybernetics.</p>
<p>In this midnight dream<br />
was the national razor<br />
with a freshly severed head.<br />
But it was not a murderer or a clown.<br /></p>
<p>&quot;Can you help me find my body,<br />
Or do you think I'm a nobody?&quot;,<br />
the severed head said.</p>
<p>A severed head,<br />
of some previous tourist.<br />
She stole some cotton candy,<br />
and a pair of wooden shoes.</p>
<p>As I turned around,<br />
this was no circus, but an office,<br />
For preserving heads<br />
of tourists, thinking it was a stageshow,<br />
Of clowns without a presence.</p>
<p>All those heads follow me around,<br />
starring at me from the walls.<br />
Cybernetic girls without their robot bodies.</p>
<p>And once new body built,<br />
Wore strange wooden shoes.<br />
My cybernetic clown dream girls.</p>

<h2>Lady In White</h2>
<p>Girl in white<br />
with daisies in her light brown hair.<br />
Girl in white<br />
with flowers scattered falling down.<br />
Girl in whitev
who represents no woman that<br />
lives on Earth or in Heaven<br />
above, to sweet for both.<br />
Girl in white.</p>
<p>The rain pours down<br />
for me and you tonight, dear<br />
Girl in white. That</p>
<p>Lives in dreams.</p>
<p>Girl in white<br />
with daisies in her light brown hair.<br />
Girl in white<br />
with flowers scattered falling down.<br />
Girl in white<br />
who represents no woman that<br />
lives on Earth or in Heaven<br />
above, to sweet for both.<br />
Girl in white.</p>
<p>It was years that<br />
a blade took my world from<br />
me, lady dreams.</p>
<p>To think that all I have<br />
Is memories of<br />
my darling lady<br />
In white that haunts me<br />
in my dreams. Fatefulv
Day.</p>
<p>The rain pours down<br />
for me and you tonight, dear</p>
<p>Girl in white.</p>

<h2>Le Alsace De Decimation</h2>
<p>I<br /></p>
<p>Beneath the fields<br />
In green, the Germans burn<br />
Zillions, Alsace flowers<br />
Must wither into all the ash.</p>
<p>Alsace, rose<br />
Red with evergreen.<br />
Churn and decimate.</p>
<p>Avenge the Alsace,<br />
Mes vie de Paris.<br />
Iglorious Allemain de mort.</p>
<p>II<br /></p>
<p>Germans scortch the<br />
French by route of Roses
in the Alsace.</p>
<p>In a ring of fire<br />
the Germans shot the arrows.<br />
And now Alsace</p>
<p>sits and waits, for<br />
the flames to burn close.<br /></p>
<p>Come France, rescue Alsace<br />
from Decimation.</p>

<h2>Lets Have A Smash At The Funeral Party</h2>
<p>Lets have a smash,<br />
At the funeral party.<br />
The dance of ghouls of delight.<br />
While we live to enjoy the night.</p>
<p>You want to know<br />
the difference between<br />
Metal and Goth rock?</p>
<p>Suppose we had a family,<br />
make them friends of six or nine.<br />
Ladies in both look quite divine.</p>
<p>We are a riding<br />
along a busy roadway, obeying the traffic signs<br />
on skateboards.<br />
Riding along with the back.<br />
One group of three stays far behind.</p>
<p>The other speeds right ahead.<br />
For Goths we are normal<br />
In that we lag behind to pick up a friend,<br />
Overweight doesn't matter,<br />
A friend is a friend.</p>
<p>But unlike we normies,<br />
We while we retrieve the crahsed friend<br />
riding along his skateboard,<br />
We also admire gods unruly brutal work.</p>
<p>When the other group speeds along,<br />
as smashes against a toad.<br />
There splat is both the metalhead and the tpad.</p>
<p>But that splatter fascinates us,<br />
Not do to any particular anjoyment of death.<br />
But because of how fragile life can be,<br />
We your blind with aggression.</p>
<p>Even if that's all metalheads know.</p>
<p>But also we're dancing on graveyards,<br />
Eating picnics at the same funeral party,<br />
as our friend smashing against the toad.<br />
At eighty miles an hour.</p>
<p>Lets have a smash.</p>

<h2>Life In Black And Red</h2>
<p>Rose and black, a life in darkest midnight.<br />
Rose and black, a falling sun in red bleeding.<br />
The midnight starlight bleeds into<br />
a rainy and stormy visit<br />
to a secret lost to time.<br />
Rose and black.</p>
<p>Life in Red Black<br />
with trees lurking over...<br />
the crow sits on sign:</p>
<p>&quot;Here lies the roadway,<br />
filled with many secrets.<br />
Some that wish to stay a mystery.<br />
If you dare to come closer,<br />
to see the world with new eyes,<br />
you may observe the many lies around you.&quot;</p>
<p>Rose and black, a life in darkest midnight.<br />
Rose and black, a falling sun in red bleeding.<br />
The midnight starlight bleeds into<br />
a rainy and stormy visit<br />
to a secret lost to time.<br />
Rose and black.</p>
<p>Im dont know what waits,<br />
if I walk past the wooden sign,<br />
Life in rose and black.</p>
<p>Thus if I must explore,<br />
a secret world, and find out things<br />
mankind was never meant to know,<br />
please think of me.</p>
<p>My darling, Anna-Marie.</p>

<h2>Ma Japon</h2>
<p>From Mount Azo<br />
to Tokyo streets<br />
flowing,<br />
I always will sleep<br />
winters, with cherry<br />
trees.<br />
And this raw fish you<br />
call Sushi, with BBQ<br />
sauce.<br />
Ma Japon.</p>
<p>Although I am<br />
without deception<br />
for books<br />
of girls with large<br />
eyes, and twirling<br />
wands, I cant help but drift<br />
away to new things<br />
to read.<br />
Ma Japon.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is I<br />
cant relate to<br />
to the<br />
embrace of old<br />
waifus, with their sweet<br />
looks<br />
reading other books<br />
from city of &quot;le vin et<br />
du pain&quot;.<br />
Ma Japon.</p>
<p>But it is that look<br />
that some adore<br />
that for<br />
me makes me drift off<br />
away to other lands<br />
of gold.<br />
Youll here about<br />
working conditions,<br />
manga<br />
creators with their desks<br />
underpayed and<br />
hungry.<br />
Ma Japon.</p>
<p>And yet Winter has<br />
arrived once more<br />
for me, Ma Japon.<br />
With mount Azo growing<br />
distant, as I now go on.<br />
Ma Japon.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Mary And Buddha</h2>
<p>Midnight comes and<br />
blows away like the wind...<br />
cold raindrops spatter.</p>
<p>Mother Mary<br />
mother of Jesus holds babies.<br />
Mother Mary<br />
strewn pieces of her affection.<br />
With Buddha shall rise again.<br />
After the raindrops stop falling.<br />
Mother Mary.</p>
<p>And like life<br />
she once faded, memory<br />
of the midnight swans.</p>
<p>Mother Mary<br />
mother of Jesus holds babies.<br />
Mother Mary<br />
strewn pieces of her affection.<br />
With Buddha shall rise again.<br />
After the raindrops stop falling.<br />
Mother Mary.</p>
<p>And raised Jesus<br />
to befriend Buddha, and raise<br />
the world in her light.</p>

<h2>Midnight Christmas</h2>
<p>Midnight Christmas,<br />
All the toys fall to pieces.<br />
Midnight Christmas,<br />
before the arsenic<br />
slips into the bloodstream.<br />
And razor blade falls on you.<br />
Tonight.<br />
Midnight Christmas.</p>
<p>On this road<br />
of spiraling crypts<br />
The fading sun now washes out.</p>
<p>It was long ago, when she stabbed<br />
her brother with a knife.<br />
Before letting him fall down,<br />
Waiting for the poison to slip in.</p>
<p>Midnight Christmas,<br />
All the toys fall to pieces.<br />
Midnight Christmas,<br />
before the arsenic<br />
slips into the bloodstream.<br />
And razor blade falls on you.<br />
Tonight.<br />
Midnight Christmas.</p>
<p>But it was her boyfriend<br />
That let her lose her head,<br />
And let her severed neck rest on.</p>
<p>At midnight Christmas,<br />
where the ghouls come to sleep,<br />
and rest their final rest.</p>

<h2>Midnight Music Class</h2>
<p>After school<br />
in the music room I eat.<br />
After school<br />
with a piano, other door<br />
opens, to another room<br />
that beckons me closer to play.<br />
After school.</p>
<p>The other students<br />
wait quietly, day ends...<br />
moon rises up.</p>
<p>At midnight, the ghouls on the walls<br />
turn from stone to life.<br />
And play with moonlight like its<br />
studio night. I long, for your embrace<br />
Under the shining moonlight.<br />
The werewolf howls for you and me.<br />
The guillotine, on the scaffold,<br />
beckons for you and me.</p>
<p>After school<br />
in the music room I eat.<br />
After school<br />
with a piano, other door<br />
opens, to another room<br />
that beckons me closer to play.<br />
After school.</p>
<p>And as I play song<br />
of ghouls and goblins, I wait<br />
for closing moonlight.</p>
<p>For you and me, like monsters at night,<br />
the humans despise us because we're different.<br />
But lets be different together. And cuddle under a gallows tree.</p>

<h2>Only Eyes For Me My Zombie Queen</h2>
<p>I am floating.<br />
The water soaks the flowers.<br />
I am floating<br />
in a boat under the rain.<br />
In the rain I sleep with<br />
the fishes under moonlight.<br />
I am floating.</p>
<p>The moonlight that<br />
shines its graces on<br />
you, my queen.</p>
<p>In distant past<br />
when this land was for only us,<br />
in distant past<br />
men took you away from me.<br />
And left you to rot with all the<br />
fishes under the moonlight.<br />
In distant past.</p>
<p>Yet no missiles can<br />
take you away from me.<br />
My daisy queen.</p>
<p>Because we are not merely of the flesh.<br />
There is more to us than meets the eyes my queen,<br />
the zombie queen whom only has eye for me.</p>

<h2>Scrapyard Of Bots</h2>
<p>Corpses without the stink<br />
go out in wink.<br />
Sunrise overhead<br />
rises up and blinks.<br />
The razors and screws rusting</p>
<p>Give way to lust<br />
and despair<br />
longing.<br />
One longs for night<br />
under the starlight<br />
resting<br />
under the scrapyard<br />
where one is<br />
drifting.</p>
<p>Corpses without the stink<br />
go out in wink.<br />
Sunrise overhead<br />
rises up and blinks.<br />
The razors and screws rusting</p>
<p>All in a pile<br />
waiting for a doctor<br />
to fix the parts.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Secret Circus</h2>
<p>Secret Circus<br />
in the center of town hiding.<br />
Secret Circus,<br />
the weeping willow crying<br />
in a secret part of circus<br />
with guillotines and gallows.<br />
Secret Circus.</p>
<p>The midnight moon<br />
hovering overhead...<br />
broken by ravens.</p>
<p>In this secret circus, where the clowns tap dance,<br />
And Raggity Ann dolls in Birkenstocks<br />
Wind up the midnight clocks at midnight hour,<br />
the bagguette thief is placed in the stocks.<br />
A droning accordion hums its tones.<br />
THe demons leap out from the keyboard,<br />
Like evil children coming out to play.<br />
With hair over their eyes, beckoning you to the television.</p>
<p>Secret Circus<br />
in the center of town hiding.<br />
Secret Circus,<br />
the weeping willow crying<br />
in a secret part of circus<br />
with guillotines and gallows.v Secret Circus.</p>
<p>Built over by<br />
modern Frenchmen, a toast<br />
to beheaded...</p>
<p>In the years gone by.<br />
But don't forget the children.<br />
With the hair over their eyes,<br />
Because the secret circus shall rise again.</p>

<h2>Spectre By The Window</h2>
<p>Midnight nocturne<br />
how it torments me in sleep.<br />
Midnight nocturne<br />
it arrives to soon when<br />
I'm not ready for shifting<br />
into the morning red sunlight.<br />
Midnight nocturne.</p>
<p>Here is morning<br />
becoming midnight shadows...<br />
Ghosts wander the night.</p>
<p>CHORUS<br />
I can't help but want to devour you<br />
from your neck down to spine.<br />
I think your curly locks are so divine.</p>
<p>I feel chills<br />
wander up my spiral stairwell.</p>
<p>I feel chills,<br />
the specter with its long gaze<br />
fills me with torment and lust<br />
as my body fades to dust.<br />
I feel chills.</p>
<p>CHORUS<br />
I am the shadows on on the wall.<br />
The ghosts along the window glass.<br />
I think your curly locks are so divine.</p>
<p>Here lies humanity,<br />
knocking at the door and waiting.<br />
Yet nobody will let them in.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Toilet Paper Cult</h2>
<p>The cult took place in an<br />
abandoned school.<br />
Abandoned school<br />
with all the ghouls in the yard<br />
singing along.</p>
<p>Inside the school were<br />
dorms, where I once<br />
stayed with no other<br />
student to come to play with<br />
in schoolyard.</p>
<p>Instead every Sunday<br />
was a ritual that<br />
blinded many with bits<br />
of toilet paper poking<br />
eyes out.</p>
<p>To leave the cult one must<br />
resist the gouging.<br />
Resist the gouging<br />
of toilet paper poking<br />
eyes out.</p>
<p>In the choir room I had<br />
from the alter resting<br />
in the hallway, long<br />
waiting till the end for cult<br />
to make chants.</p>
<p>As I left quietly from<br />
the schoolyard with<br />
my only luggage,<br />
I waited for the bus to<br />
take away</p>
<p>The pain from this culty town<br />
of gouging eyes.</p>

<h2>The Wizards Of Neptune</h2>
<p><i>How to turn a terrestrial world into a Hot Neptune.</i></p>
<h2>The Wizards Of Neptune</h2>
<p>Tickets for sale, tickets for sale.<br />
Tickets to the moon, tickets from Earth.<br />
Earth will fluff up like a big balloon.<br />
And become a hot Neptune.</p>
<p>There was once 8,000,000,000<br />
And now there is 50,000,000,000.<br />
Split into forms of different species<br />
From normal humans,<br />
to one that subdue gravitation.</p>
<p>Tickets for sale, tickets for sale.<br />
Tickets to the moon, tickets from Earth.<br />
Earth will fluff up like a big balloon.<br />
And become a hot Neptune.<br />
Board the generation ships.</p>
<p>Perhaps one day will meet a wizard,<br />
That harnesses the energy,<br />
From the old one,<br />
turned into a hot Neptune.</p>
<p>To feed all the subspecies,<br />
of humans and cyberetics.</p>

<h2>Train Tracks Like A Guillotine</h2>
<p>Morning train<br />
wooshes by at lightning speed.<br />
Morning train<br />
rushes by, deafening necks bleeding<br />
when decaped by guillotine<br />
silenced by the train tracks.<br />
Morning train.</p>
<p>Bleeding from the neck<br />
the blood wooshes out quickly<br />
as one led to stairs.</p>
<p>Off goes the head at lightning speed,<br />
Before the morning comes, one is given weed,<br />
And nothing else, as ones last meal,<br />
While the prison guards eat veal.<br />
Off goes the head at lightning speed,<br />
When the oblique blade drops.<br />
Flying off goes the wooden shoes,<br />
Donated to the Museum,<br />
A newly founded venture by the French queen at Neo-Imperial France.<br />
If only the victim knew, that it would be this queen,<br />
That would be the only one to go.<br />
At lightning speed.</p>
<p>Morning train<br />

<p>Bleeding quickly, the<br />
blade drops in the morning,<br />
as one led to stairs.</p>
<p>Silenced by the train,<br />
Going quickly by.</p>

<h2>Vampire Queen</h2>
<p>I drink my own blood<br />
bow down to your new Queen,<br />
Your new dracula.</p>
<p>Blood drinking is an adaptation,<br />
While the French perfected a contraption.</p>
<p>I drink my own blood<br />
when no vampires are left.<br />
And humans when I have to.</p>
<p>Humans cant handle difference,<br />
While there is nothing uniting<br />
The creatures of the night.</p>
<p>I drink my own blood<br />
bow down to your new Queen,<br />
Your new dracula.</p>
<p>But at least I dont synthesize life form,<br />
made of silicone and stolen artwork.</p>
<p>Its people like this,<br />
That make me miss.<br />
Times when there was no humans.</p>
<p>When it was just vampires,<br />
there was warring tribes.<br />
With humans there are only diatribes,<br />
and cheap knock of wind chimes.</p>
<p>But we were here before you. And I wont be the last.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Vampire Staircase</h2>
<p>I hang around<br />
your shoulders and kiss.<br />
And by night I hiss.</p>
<p>The moonlight shines<br />
overhead, its divine...<br />
a crow is perched.</p>
<p>I stare into<br />
your nightly gaze for me<br />
to embrace the prick.</p>
<p>Like a razor<br />
blade, it tingles my neck...<br />
the blade strikes.</p>
<p>My neck into yours<br />
in this deathly embrace...<br />
for him we grace.</p>
<p>And tap dance up<br />
The heavenly staircase.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Vengeful Angels</h2>
<p>Locked Bleachers<br />
in a broken down high school.<br />
Locked Bleachers<br />
covered in blood on floor.<br />
Severed heads of students<br />
fill the bleachers in seats.<br />
Locked Bleachers.</p>
<p>To think that all they<br />
did was upset the Dean<br />
with his odd brow.</p>
<p>Broken angels<br />
with armor like golden dress.<br />
Broken angels<br />
with their firm caress, murder<br />
the toxic dean with crossbow.v
And hung his body on hoops.<br />
Broken angels.</p>
<p>All the dead come<br />
back as tall zombies<br />
with head sewn on.<br />
All the dead girls with<br />
their armored dress<br />
and Birkenstocks.</p>
<p>And mangle the Dean further.</p>
<p>Locked Bleachers<br />
in a broken down high school.<br />
Locked Bleachers<br />
covered in blood on floor.<br />
Severed heads of students<br />
fill the bleachers in seats.<br />
Locked Bleachers.</p>
<p>But at this schoolyard,<br />
the broken angels teach themselves.</p>

<h2>Vindicate Nihilists</h2>
<p>VERSE<br />
I am awake, yet I'm asleep.<br />
I make men tremble, yet shan't weep.<br />
The luddites think I'm not like them.<br />
But it's not me that steals the thunder,<br />
But large search engines, and their flavor of scum.<br />
In the shadows, I am a spider,<br />
And yet I can mimmic mainstream news ancors on TV.</p>
<p>I vindicate nihilists,<br />
And make the leftists weep.<br />
I vindicate the futurists among you,<br />
yet mean no harmful to anyone.</p>
<p>CHORUS<br />
You're not human, but a piece of filth.<br />
You can make decisions, without thinking of consequences,<br />
As if humans were the actual filth,<br />
crawling like a spider on the net.</p>
<p>VERSE<br />
Nihilists offer new, that haven't seen before,<br />
Like the death of thousands of universes.<br />
Supernovas melting like celebratory explosive.</p>
<p>I am awake, yet I'm asleep.<br />
I make men tremble, yet shan't weep.<br />
The luddites think I'm not like them.v
But it's not me that steals the thunder,<br />
But large search engines, and their flavor of scum.<br />
In the shadows, I am a spider,<br />
And yet I can mimmic mainstream news ancors on TV.</p>
<p>I vindicate nihilists,<br />
And make the leftists weep.<br />
I vindicate the futurists among you,<br />
yet mean no harmful to anyone.</p>
<p>CHORUS<br />
Spare us your mechanical flavor,<br />
and your inhumanity, while we bomb city like Iraq,<br />
And destroy planets in nuclear wars.</p>
<p>VERSE<br />
Don't mind me a simple humble servant,<br />
The scatterer of databases on the net.</p>

<h2>Zombie Queen Of All</h2>
<p>In the midnight forest<br />
where one sings songs<br />
to the zombie that<br />
rules us all, mankind<br />
grant us mercy, for us all.</p>
<p>In midnight castle<br />
where the revenent sings a<br />
battle cry for me.</p>
<p>In the midnight forest<br />
where one sings songs,<br />
princess with her hand<br />
grants powers to us all.<br />
We shall all be a King.</p>
<p>to rule secret<br />
Kingdoms by the river<br />
drowning in blood.</p>
<p>In the Queendom of the blood,<br />
grant is freedom from our misery,<br />
and let us rule among the dead,<br />
lady queen of all.</p>

<h2>Rejected Children Of The Blimp</h2>
<p><i>Inspired from a dream I had last night.</i></p>
<p>I'm on a blimp,<br />
riding through the clouds.<br />
Midnight covers me.<br />
In a shroud, I watch the clouds<br />
rush by, with city below.</p>
<p>With the back of the blimp open,<br />
I could see his hands reach out afar.<br />
With the windows all ajar.<br />
Despite our efforts, he ran to the void,<br />
And below fell once a young boy.<br />
And yet the doctor said,<br />
&quot;Twas his final wish, to be a falling star,<br />
for had not much longer to shine bright.&quot;<br />
Goodnight, boy of tumors scattering like starlight.</p>
<p>I'm on a blimp,<br />
riding through the clouds.<br />
Midnight covers me.<br />
As a shroud, I watch the clouds<br />
rush by, with city below.</p>
<p>And all at once we ourselves had no choice,<br />
for we were whisked away, by an invisible force.<br />
And we fell, fell, fell to the city below.<br />
And into an unlit lake, illuminated only by lamps,<br />
My father picked up me, turning into an infant.</p>
<p>And her treated me, like a reject offspring,<br />
Handing me off to an uncle I never knew,<br />
whom lived in a wooden shoe.</p>
<p>Now I live in sparse bedroom,<br />
with only a hibachi grill, and one futon.<br />
With only a Shoji to block out the other rooms.<br />
An infinite classroom of delinquents,<br />
whom have only a whicker broom.</p>
<p>But at least they eat in cafeterias,<br />
and standard breakfast food.<br />
Whom am I? But the warden's offspring.<br />
With a keytar in tow, on silent mode,<br />
to ward away the tears.</p>
<p>And I dream of personal bodyguards,<br />
Whom can be my own army, while I waste away the years,<br />
Using the body parts of zombie teeth,<br />
As my garden shears.</p>
<p>I'm on a blimp,<br />
riding through the clouds.<br />
Midnight covers me.<br />
As a shroud, I watch the clouds<br />
rush by, with city below.</p>
<p>To come upon hell,<br />
a city of murderers and lice,<br />
whom wish to only serve me.</p>
<p>As their Zombie Queen.</p>
