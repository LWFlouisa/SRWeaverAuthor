        <h2>Blood Of Katolinio</h2>
<p>I woke up in the countryside, not remembering exactly how I got there. From my observation, it seemed I was far away from the big city. I could feel the wind gently blow across my soft, flowing, black hair, and in the distance I saw what looked like a Renaissance fair. An odd time to have one it seemed to me, since I always went to them in May when I was growing up.</p>
<p>Funny how you get used to something and think that's how it is everywhere. No one could have blamed me for being curious about this whole scene, though. What the hell had happened, had I passed out somewhere and gotten dumped here? I could smell the moldy aroma of decaying leaves on the dirt road. It must have been about five o'clock, but I couldn't pinpoint the time exactly because I had never really found the need to wear a watch, at least not until I arrived here.</p>
<p>I walked along the road, taking a minute or so to observe my surroundings. To be honest I wasn't really sure where I was, because the roads weren't paved, and there were no traffic lights. Actually, at that moment, not only were there not any cars, but it felt as if I were in Amish country. I took my flashlight out of my pouch, just in case it got dark enough where I couldn't see clearly. I could see cows grazing across the fields, which was definitely not a normal occurrence in my town. Farming had slowly trickled down to nothing over the last decade, and now in 2030 you almost never saw a farm animal.</p>
<p>I finally reached the fare site, but when I arrived, there wasn't a place to buy tickets. Not only that, but as I walked further into the odd town, the residents looked at me rather strangely, as if I were some kind of demon. My style of dressing, let's call it decidedly feminine, was not the norm. My hair cascading down my back might seem unusual too. When I arrived at one of the shops, there was not any kind of electricity. Nothing to indicate I was in the modern era. I walked up to the clerk at the counter.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd like to purchase a coke please.&quot; I said, and the clerk gave me a strange look. I would have to get used to that.</p>
<p>&quot;What is a coke?&quot; The cerk said, and the confusion in the clerks face let me know he wasn't yanking my chain.</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind, just give me some kind of drink, if you will.&quot; I said.
&quot;Sure.&quot; The Clerk said, and I was impressed the clerk was being friendly enough, since he definitely seemed to think I was odd. He gave me a drink that resembled some kind of pale ale. Then he said: &quot;That will be five pence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait, you guys don't take the dollar?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;A dollar?&quot; The clerk said, and gave me another of his strange looks. This time I gave him my own puzzled look. I thought: What kind of hell hole did I pop myself into?</p>
<p>&quot;Ugh, never mind. Can you just tell me where a bathroom is?&quot; I said.</p>
<p>Surely they would at least have running water. He pointed me in the direction of the place that apparently passed for a bathroom to him. With a quick glance, I could see it wasn't very clean. I thought: That's not a good way to generate business. I wasn't desperate enough to use it, and decided to wait until I could find a cleaner one. I started to thank the clerk and ask him where I was, and more importantly how could I get back to civilization, but he was busy with someone else at that point, so I left.</p>
<p>I was thinking I would just try to find some generous family willing to let me in, show me where I was on a map, and help me figure out a way home, and not too far down the road, I found that kind family. They were dressed in the Renaissance theme, and I was impressed that the whole town seemed to get into the spirit of the fair. Fortunately for me, I had arrived just in time for supper. After being invited to join them, I began to eat the meal I was offered. The plates they used were definitely unique.</p>
<p>They were more like a rock hard stale bread, flattened out to eat on. The man who seemed to be the father began to speak to me: &quot;So where are you from, you don't dress like you're from around here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&quot;He could be from the far east!&quot; The wife proposed that idea.&quot; The older mother said.</p>
<p>I guess that would make sense to them, I thought to myself, the Chinese do dress a bit differently from people in the west. I responded: &quot;Well, honestly, I've more interested in figuring out where I am than where I came from. I'm not hanging around. Heck, I never knew you could spend the night at a Renaissance fair.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A Renaissance fair?&quot; One of thel little girls said.</p>
<p>All the faces around the table looked at me like I was deranged.</p>
<p>&quot;You mean you guys have gotten so immersed in this place that you forgot it was a fair?&quot; I asked, figuring they would know it was a rhetorical question. Just a little joke. Nobody made a sound, they just gave me more of those odd looks, so I asked another question to test their sense of time and place. Hell, maybe it was me that was off, I had no idea.</p>
<p>&quot;So what year is it anyway?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;You're being silly, this is 1063.&quot; The older woman said, and at first I thought she was joking. I struggled not to choke on my turkey leg, but then I noticed none of them were laughing, and were staring right at me.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you might just be getting tired. I can ask the children to go make your bed.&quot; The husband said.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I would like that, thank you.&quot; I said, and was just glad they hadn't decided to throw me out. I was extremely tired.</p>
<p>&quot;Ann and Bobby, could you kindly go make this lady man's bed?&quot; The older mother said.</p>
<p>Lady man? Interesting, it didn't actually bother me to be called that, and he didn't seem to say it with any bad intention. They climbed the handcarved stairway, and did as they were told. Nowadays I would have expected lots of complaining about letting a stranger in the house in the first place, let alone having to make the bed for him. I guessed this family had been brought up with old-fashioned values.</p>
<p>&quot;Have a good night sleep.&quot; The older mother said.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>I had a particularly hard time getting to sleep that night. I was thinking about my less than honorable past, back when I used to vandalize cars and other property, and served time in a state prison. I was also suspected of about five murders, but I was never charged because there was not enough DNA evidence linking me to them. So I only had to serve about five years for the vandalism. With those thoughts on my mind, I drifted in and out of sleep, but eventually fell into a deep slumber.</p>
<p>The next morning, I was awakened by a horn blowing nearby, several times in a row, so that was it for my sleep. I went downstairs and asked the man of the house what was going on. He told me the horn was sounded when there was going to be an execution. Apparently some girl with a history of being a thief was going to be executed for murder that very day. Of course I was still clinging to the idea that this was all some over-the-top production for the Renaissance fair, so I didn't think they would do it. I have to admit, I was more than a little curious, as I bet most people would have been in this situation.</p>
<p>By the time we got outside, there was already a crowd gathering around the scaffold. Then I saw a girl in ragged clothes, with chains around her ankles and waist, climbing the stairs. She looked about fifteen. I began to have this sinking feeling, and was really hoping these people weren't psycho. At the same time I felt this sense of anticipation, and seemed to become one of the mob here to see her die. I could see the girl pray to her heavenly father, and finally she kneeled and placed her neck upon the block. I was frozen by a mix of curiosity and dread, and felt a little bad choosing to just sit there and watch. It was becoming all too apparent this was a real execution, and I was just standing there. I thought: Had anyone even proved she was guilty, and was death really the punishment for theft?</p>
<p>Once again I wondered where the hell I was, as I saw the axe tumble down, and then her head fall into the basket. Messy, but I had seen worse. However being up close and personal, I realized this one seemed particularly morbid to me. But I had no idea why. Maybe because she was just on the verge of womanhood, and I had briefly entertained the thought of her as date material. But either way, I saw her head fall in the basket, and the deed was done. She would not be dating me or any other.</p>
<p>Now it seemed obvious that I had entered some sort of alternate society, where the people had found a way to avoid the laws and customs of the modern world. I had heard of cults that separated from society for the freedom to live as they pleased, but this seemed pretty radical. I realized it might not be as simple to leave this place as I had hoped, since they wouldn't want their existence to be discovered. I decided to go with the flow, which meant another night here at least. Leaving so soon after the execution might make it seem like I was fleeing, maybe to report it to authorities in the next town. That night I couldn't sleep again, but this time it was because I could not get what I had seen out of my head. I wondered why it was bothering me so much, since I had never really been an emotional person.</p>
<p>I had done my share of unsavory stuff, but none of it seemed as inhumane as the act I had just witnessed. Somehow I managed to get some sleep, but then my third eye took over. I saw the executed girl in a white dress, surrounded by a blue glow standing by a lake. She was staring at me, and the confusion that had surrounded me since I had woken up in this hell hole seemed to melt away. The girl in my dream had revealed to me that I hadn't stumbled upon some alternate society in 2030. No, I had somehow fallen through a portal into the ninth century, for the purpose of witnessing her execution.</p>
<p>Why it involved me I still didn't know. I just knew I had to get out of there, and fast. Early that morning, I bid the man that took care of me farewell. His final statement to me was to stay off the roads at night. Strange things seem to happen to people, sometimes there never found again. I made my exit of the house, and exited the village into a forest trail. It didn't matter to me if I was going in the wrong direction, so long as I got away from these psycho paths.</p>
<p>It was a lighter dusk than normal, for the man in the moon was fully awake, observing my every move. I noticed there were not many signs telling me where I was, so I had to rely on my intuition. Surely it would not take long for me to reach the next village at least. I can worry about finding a portal later. A couple of hours later, I decided I would rest on the closest tree I could find. I situated myself as carefully as I could, so not to hurt myself. I drifted in and out of sleep because I wasn't very comfortable. But eventually I was able to dose off. In my third eye, I saw that girl again.</p>
<p>&quot;Why did you let me die?&quot; She asked.</p>
<p>It was her fault she was in the wrong place at the wrong time, or so I felt at the time. Later, I woke up to find three large scratches across my chest. How did those get there? Those were definitely going to take some stitches. But didn't have time to worry about it write then. I pushed my feet up, took out my knife, and cut off a part of my pants to bind up the wound. I could feel it stinging, but I couldn't really bitch about it write now. If I had a compass with me, maybe I wouldn't have gotten lost.</p>
<p>&quot;Yea, keep deluding yourself Albert, I know you feel terrible. You should go back and confess to the murder yourself.&quot; The girls voice said.</p>
<p>Was someone talking to me, or was I hearing voices in my own head? It sounded like the voice of a young girl. I started walking again, and found myself hoping on one leg. So much for the safety measure. When I arrived at my destination, there was not a human soul, and yet there was no indication of any kind of disturbance. It was almost as if the town went on with its normal activities, without its residents setting foot on the soil. I walked into the town square, every now and then seeing blood along the walls. Yet there were no bodies that could be found. As if the earth swallowed them up.</p>
<p>I could feel my heart pounding again, and gasped for as much air as I could. When I arrived at the market center, I could see a scaffold, a bloody headmans block, and a weeping willow swaying in the gentle breeze. I climbed the scaffold to take a taste of the blood. I dipped my index finger in it. And then I had that voice in my head again: &quot;Do you like the taste Albert, its your own blood. Your own fresh blood.&quot;</p>
<p>It could not be her. After all, there was no way for her to get inside my head. And then I woke up, and found myself laying on the tree of where I thought I originally woke up. I wondered how much time had passed. It was early, but I decided to press on.</p>
<p>Nothing much happened this morning, although my wounds have healed a little bit. I took off my bandages, since my wounds needed some air to breath. It was now the second afternoon of my trek, and It was a colder type of hell, but at least for now that voice has not bothered me. I didn't know why I worried about it so much. I could feel something watching me from further in the woods along the trail. It didn't feel quite human, so I decided not to hang around. I thought it would be safer to follow the mans directions a little more strictly this time. I could not turn a flashlight on, since I didnt have one. So I needed to take the safest route.</p>
<p>I decided I would try to get away from the sound as quickly as I could. I didn't exactly want to know what was behind me. And then I hid behind one of the signs along the dirt road. I never saw it directly, but from what I could tell, it was a silhouette of a small headless body. Whether it was a male or female I could not tell. and then I heard that voice again.</p>
<p>&quot;Come out come out wherever you are, you know you can't hide.&quot; A girls voice said.</p>
<p>Was the voice coming from that thing over there? And then I saw the feminine creature dissipate, and dissolve before my eyes. I could feel myself getting tired again, and could not resist the temptation to sleep. I blacked out with tiredness, for I could not force myself up any longer.</p>
<p>In my third eye, I was in that isolated town again, but now the heads mans block had somebody kneeling on it. It was a feminine silhouette, I could not see its face. I could not save the girl, for my body was frozen, and I could do nothing. Then I woke up from a loud scream, resting right behind the road sign.</p>
<p>When I walked along the road, I saw another silhouette, but it resembled more like a seven foot tall man. It was holding a bloody shovel, and the humanoid began to slowly crawl toward me. So I took out my knife to defend myself. However, something else popped out of the woods that had more of a parasitic appearance. It was holding a baseball bat, and beat the human creature to death.</p>
<p>My headache was gone, and it was now daylight. Oddly enough, I was unharmed through the incident last night. But I still had to be careful. It was now day three of my misadventure, and I finally arrived at the small forest village covered in a thick green fog. I could see the burned walls where the cabins once stood, and the smell of iron clenched my throat. In the distance I could see human figures chained to a wall. I thought: Is this a form of prison?</p>
<p>I went to go see if they were alive. Went I got close, I found they were nothing but stained skeletons. There legs and arms have been horrendously dislocated. I thought I could see one of them twitch, as if they were still alive. I looked, and didn't see anything unusual. I however did not want to hang around, as any man with any bit of intelligence would not. I struggled to find a place top hide, before it got dark. Did the man send me into a death trap?</p>
<p>In this small cabin I've been staying in until morning, I tried to nab whatever supplies I could find. However the place was completely barren. I then walked out the door, being careful not to run into anything, and made my way to the abandoned to church. Surely they must have some kind of library, and I could look there to find out what was going on. I walked inside, and closed the doors.</p>
<p>After I closed the doors, I found myself in the worship hall. I guess it was a better smell than outside, but not by much. There was still a scent of mold polluting the air, as if it had not been cleaned in a while. I walked down the hall, and heard the giggle of a little girl in one of the halls. I went to go look, but I didn't find anyone. I was the only here, which was sort of a mixed blessing. Then I realized I was walking in the wrong direction. So I retraced my steps, and finally found the book hall. I grabbed a book on the churches history and place in Katolinio's society.</p>
<p>According to the information presented, the towns history was known for indiscriminate executions of anyone, regardless of the age of the accused. But then five years ago, a plague broke out which created a famine, which was theorized to be gods wrath for murdering his own children. Whatever the case, because of the lack of edible crops, they had to resort to eating dogs and cats. When that ran out, they began to turn on each other. I thought: That would explain the dislocated skeletons chained to the churches wall.</p>
<p>It also mentioned something about the unique appearance of the residents. Because of the lack of a great deal of sunlight, they were more pale than other people in the region. They were known for their bright blue yes, and light brown hair. Then I had images in my head again about that girl from earlier. I remember she looked similar to the description described in these pages. I exited the church, but before I could exit the town, found myself being attacked by a humanoid. I was able to hold it off until it passed out on its own. And then I exited the village never to return.</p>
<p>I decided along my path that it would not be worth going back to the village. I was a selfish creature by heart, even if I felt guilty for not saving the girl. Then along my path I found some portal back home, but before I could exit, I was overpowered by the parasite and the humanoid that snuck on me. And then I woke up back in my apartment. and I wondered if it had all been a dream. I looked in the mirror in my bathroom. In my minds eye, I saw the village were I was taken care of in, burnt to the ground. And then a black headless silhouette stared at me in the mirror.</p>
<p>The next morning, a private detective investigated my corpse. They could not find a known cause. But he was able to guess to the police: &quot;Sire, I think she clawed her at own throat.&quot;</p>
<h2>Father Out Of Time</h2>
<p>I remember it as if it were yesterday.</p>
<p>My father's boot steps, I could hear them … stopping at the door. Then a knock. Mother, who was stressed all evening last night, had a smiled after a long time. She opened the door, a there</p>
<p>to greet us was old dad. &quot;Your home! Emmet, Hannah, papa's home!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How have you squirts been!&quot; my father asked, carefully making sure not to hold me to tight. I could remember his long yard stare, and it wasn't until recently that I finally realized the meaning of what was on his face.</p>
<p>&quot;Our son George won the spelling bee last week!&quot; my mother said.</p>
<p>&quot;Really, that's awesome.&quot; my father said.</p>
<p>It was the next morning. Our father's return home, created the situation that would have to celebrate a joint birthday party for the year. Just as well I guess. I didn;t mind much, by my sister wined.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh watermelon cake, if you keep wining you wont get any!&quot; The father said. He must have not been sure if it was clear he was joking, though it was clear to me as bright as the morning sunlight.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh come on honey!&quot; my mother said.</p>
<p>&quot;Relax, relax! I'm just kidding. We can have separate parties next year. Anyway lets sing together. Happy birthday to you..&quot; But the angels in heaven, had other things in store. Not a speck of food, nothing left to store. Yet then I didn't realize it yet.</p>
<p>Not wanting to move, having friends here in town, mother told me we could have a better life elsewhere. At that point, I hoped it was a promise.</p>
<p>It was when I walked through the middle school halls that I met my friend Emmet. I noticed he was hitting on the girl that he had a crush on, and then continued walking with me to class. I thought I heard the slightest spitting sound, yet not the rhythm of moving lips. The footsteps of shoes on the floor in the hall barely lit by the flickering L.E.D light.</p>
<p>&quot;Emmet, act like an adult!&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&quot;Shut up.&quot; he said.</p>
<p>I arrived to class on time, got our homework outside of my notebook, but Emmet arrived in the classroom late once again.</p>
<p>&quot;Emmet, that's a tardy slip for you. One more and its a detention.&quot; said the teacher, an elderly female teacher.</p>
<p>We sat at lunch together with his sister Hannah, and my sister. Hannah played with Emmet a little bit by trying to grab his lunch. &quot;Hands off!&quot; Emmet said, and smashed her hand with his fist.</p>
<p>Hannah picked up her hand and cries and asks, &quot;What was that for Emmet!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your not very generous.&quot; George said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very hungry!&quot; Emmet said.</p>
<p>&quot;She's probably hungry too.&quot; George said.</p>
<p>&quot;Shut up, just shut up!&quot; Emmet said, I chuckled. Hannah is still wining from her hand that hurts. &quot;Oh grow up Hannah.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You grow up Emmet.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>My and my sister walked home to the rundown depravity that was the moonzurg munster. I opened the door, Bebee went inside first. We were going to visit Emmet. Instead we found … that his mother was holding Hannah in her arms. His sister starved to death, and I wondered to myself if she was better off dead so he no longer had suffer hunger in this world. For our rations in the ghetto had decreased ten fold.</p>
<p>And I was already feeling old …</p>
<p>My first taste, a moment kiss of death.</p>
<p>We sat in class, and I noted that poor Emmet was quieter than usual. Even the girl he had lovey lovery feelings for, or at least I thought so, tried to get his attention to ask what was wrong. He just shrugged her off.</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck you bitch.&quot; Emmet said, because he realized that he loved his sister, who he had ignored all this time. He evidently did not care very much that his teacher would fuss at him for saying that.</p>
<p>&quot;You want a detention Emmet?&quot; teacher said..</p>
<p>I walked to the grave yard where Emmet and his sister rested feeling bad that I could not buy them flowers. My best, I made do with what I had. My sacked lunch from earlier. Placed it on the headstone, with an angel carved on it.</p>
<p>It was the girl I remembered Emmet crushing on that asked me about my best friend. But she found out that he was to busy to talk to her. Though she pretended not to know, on some level I wonder if she knew. Nothing left of my friend, not a speck from the ash. I stared at the window a little bit longer that morning</p>
<p>We walked home, devastated because of the lack of positive interaction between me and him before he killed himself. He couldn't handle the death of his sister. I only know, because one of his friends told me at school I didn't know very well.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Georgie, where's Emmet?&quot; BB asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know BB.&quot; George said, I didn't have the heart to tell her the truth. There was no more of Emmet and me.</p>
<p>Later that night, my father loaded up his shot gun, looked at his wife, who leaned forward on the table, with her hands in her face crying.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry dear, I don't know what to do.&quot; my father said.</p>
<p>&quot;I just don't know wants going to happen to Georgie and BB!&quot; The mother weeped. For she must have known more than we, that there was nothing left to see.</p>
<p>We slept in our beds in our crappy bed room. The wallpaper was peeling, the whole room was cracked and torn. But at least the air conditioning was still ran. Though I wasn't sure for how much longer.</p>
<p>&quot;Georgie, why aren't the other's out to play?&quot; my darling sister asked.</p>
<p>&quot;They are probably just busy with homework, it's late. We need sleep.&quot; I said. There were fewer children left in town. Everything back then was hush hush.</p>
<p>Emmet visited me in spirit, told me everything was going to be ok.</p>
<p>But was that true?</p>
<p>The sounds of sirens driving in the neighborhood. We stared out of the window. There were tall guards, men in black military uniforms. Dragging citizens out of their homes, the few that were left because many starved to death. My father was the only ones left to fight back because the father would not give up his gun.</p>
<p>He didn't last long.</p>
<p>We were shipped in a black van, though not tied. I saw that Bebee acted like a normal girl her age, wondered if she will soon wake up to the reality of the situation. She stopped spinning to the rhythm of the music box. It's melody played in my head forever.</p>
<p>&quot;Play with-&quot; BB began to say, however George interjected with, &quot;I don't want to play your stu.&quot;</p>
<p>BB Interjects George, and asks her mother &quot;Why does Georgie not want to play?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why don't you ask him sweat heart?&quot; Our mother said. BB attempted to ask me. But I was to stressed to respond. That was the last words I ever said to her. I wish it were something else, but no changing that.</p>
<p>&quot;He's probably not feeling well honey. I know, why don't you lay down and sleep?&quot; The mother proposed.</p>
<p>My family were split up by gender into two separate trains. My father stared at me while we rode the train, filled with smoking prisoners. Smoke filled the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything is going to be OK George, were going to go to a special place. A promised land, were the flowers never die. A better life.&quot; Although the father somehow I knew then he must not have believed it.</p>
<p>I began to suspect that something was seriously wrong. Looked at my nervous father with his sad sad eyes.</p>
<p>My and my father arrived at camp, went through mandatory camp inspections before going into the bunkers. Loaded up our stuff in their rudimentary shelves, that were more like scrap would. I began to worry about the fact that BB was missing, so asked father where she was, and he said he did not know.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you lose track of her?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; He stared at the window, then hugged me tight. Then continued in a whisper. &quot;… they took her away George!&quot;</p>
<p>Prisoners dug ditches into the soft dirt at around 9:00 A.M. Guards pointed the gun at my father, and fired the shotgun. The bullet barely nicked his head, and caused him to turn to face the guard. The guard, even seeing the prisoners face, fired a second time. I don't remember anything else.</p>
<p>I still remember the song he sang to us:</p>
<p>When the paradise comes to thee,<br />
Remember to laugh, and count to three,<br />
Ride with the windmills, like the wind,<br />
Remember to unwind.</p>
<p>I am laughing, but don't mistake for laughter. The last lyric of dad, your father out of time. When he went to work that morning, before everything went to hell. The sound of a music box melody, now plays in my head forever.</p>
<p>An image of my darling sister Bebee forever as I stared, into the lonely image of a news telecast on a scraper screen.</p>
<p>She smiles.</p>
<p>When the paradise comes to thee,<br />
Remember to laugh, and count to three.<br />
Come dance with me.</p>
<h2>Luena's Tenderness</h2>
<h3>Or the little rat that chewed wooden shoe strings.</h3>
<p>It was not the teeth upon her tail that caused the pain of a thousand nails nor when her sister was whipped by a guard who jeered, &quot;Take that, you lump of lard&quot;. But her father as if he were only a bother yanked up by his leg they forced him to beg for mercy.</p>
<p>She remembered it looked like a screw being ripped from plywood. No mercy was shown, and her father had died with that word on his lips. Luena's hope had died too. Her third eye was fried. There was no escaping the pain, except by giving in to the withering of her brain. Though school was still a necessary torture, she could not even do basic math problems, or write a decent sentence. She had kept trying, though, trying to do her best.</p>
<p>As Luena headed out the door on what turned out to be the last day of the life she had known, her mother repeated her frequent plea. &quot;Please don't forget to bring home dinner tonight. I know you're disgusted, but we have to eat.&quot; Luena thought of the humiliating wait in line for a measly pound of rat meat, deemed enough for a family of five, though they were now down to four. Rodent meat was all they could count on for food anymore, food that might possibly kill them should luck not be on their side when their portion was given. Luena wretched at the thought of eating another bite of rat. She could resist the hunger pains, but she had to take care of her mom and sisters.</p>
<p>Luena walked to the bus stop and waited for one of the open bed trucks used for transport. The trucks reminded her of ones used to transport soldiers, or worse, prisoners on a road crew. Her peers had nicknamed the trucks open buses, similar to the name given those short little yellow buses used to transport disabled kids in some of the stories they read in school. If you were on an open bus, you were probably going somewhere you'd rather not go; school for the lucky, or the crematorium for the unluckiest. An open bus pulled up and Luena climbed in for the ten minute ride to school. As the bus pulled into the school parking lot, Luena noticed activity near a side door of the school, then heard a scream followed by whimpering. A group of bullies had ganged up on one of her unfortunate peers, but all he'd lost was a tooth and a little blood. Nothing compared to the treatment her tribe of elves got from the police on a regular basis. Luena felt the familiar bellyache as she approached the school.</p>
<p>Luena went to all her classes. Additional ordinary bellyache. Most of her teachers hadn't cared about or noticed the change in Luena over the last week. There had been one who would smile at her faintly as she handed her memorization exercises usually used for much younger students. The teacher was trying to help coax Luena's brain back to normal so Luena wouldn't be punished for failure to finish her regular work. This teacher had been the bright spot in the otherwise bleak school day, even though Luena wondered whether the teacher suspected it wouldn't be a fruitful venture. As frequently happened to teachers, though, this one was hauled away in an open bus. A fate shared by many, especially those who were surrounded by others most of the day.</p>
<p>Every teacher carried a cane, used for intimidation and sometimes for impromptu paddling in the hall. There were no limits on the punishment teachers could dole out to students, as long as each student could walk out of school at the end of the day. So far this freedom to punish had not gotten out of hand.</p>
<p>On three of the five school days since Luena's father had died, she had been sent to In-School Suspension. Classwork had to be completed there, even though you received a zero for it. The worst part about ISS was the time it provided for Luena's mind to wander. The loss of her father was not the only loss she had suffered recently. Haunting images of Garry, the boy she had dated for only a month before he succumbed to the virus that was killing dozens of her peers daily, always entered her mind. The virus that assured you a trip on the open bus to the crematorium. She saw him foaming at the mouth, a green line forming around his lips. Garry had complained of chills, with goosebumps that would cover his arms and legs with increasing frequency, a few days before the end. His throat had begun to ache during the last day, before the vomiting began. He had been approaching the school; Luena had gotten there just ahead of him. He had doubled over, and green vomit spewed several feet around him. He caught Luena's eyes just before the police arrived to haul him away with the unlucky classmates who had been hit by his puke.</p>
<p>There were two known ways to catch the green virus, now called the green plague. Some of the rats they were forced to eat were infected with it. If you dodged that bullet, you might come in contact with the vomit of a victim. Rats and mice had been the main source of food since the oppression of her tribe had begun. Luena had lost a third of her weight, despite her mother's constant urging to eat. Her mother even seemed to look forward to the meals that included rat breast. What, did it taste like chicken, Luena wondered. Though her mother was adjusting to life without her husband, Luena knew she was in pain. But she was also driven by the need to keep her three daughters alive. Luena couldn't accept the rat diet, even though she knew she was slowly starving. She had better luck eating the mice served at school, though even with dipping sauce she had to choke them down. Luena still didn't understand why, but with the rats she felt a connection. She had even made a pet of one. So far she had succeeded in saving that one from being the evening meal.</p>
<p>Luena was jolted out of her ISS daydreaming by the force of the teacher's cane ramming into the back of her chair. She tried to return to her work, but once again wondered why it even mattered. She noticed a chill over her body, and saw the goosebumps rising on her arms. Alarm changed to calm relief. So what? She hoped it was what she thought it was.</p>
<p>When Luena returned home that afternoon she followed her normal routine, except she avoided her mother and went straight to her room. Her mother always tried to tempt her with a snack after school, some sort of rat tidbit she tried to make as tasty as possible. It never worked. Luena wasn't up to dealing with that drama. She could have the plague! Maybe not, so maybe she should do her homework, but why? She would almost certainly be in ISS again tomorrow, so all her homework would get a zero. Luena's thoughts were racing, her mother was knocking, saying they needed to talk. Goosebumps covered her arms and legs again. She remained calm and opened the door to talk to her mother.</p>
<p>&quot;What's wrong, honey? Did you get our meat?&quot;, her mother asked. Suddenly Luena knew she had to leave. Though she knew her mother was beginning to suspect something was up, she calmly said she had forgotten, and that she'd go harvest some of the tastier grasses. That was a lie, one of her sisters could do that once they realized she was gone. She closed her door and locked it, and began packing a bag. When she opened her bedroom window to leave, her mother must have heard, because she came back and began pounding on the door and yelling her name. Luena looked back at the door, then slid onto the window sill before making the short jump to the ground. By the time she was disappearing into the woods, her mother had used the key all her daughters knew she could use any time she wanted in their bedrooms. Luena was gone, though, and her mother watched and hoped she would change her mind and reappear. Another part of her knew she had to protect her other daughters.</p>
<p>She whispered, &quot;Let's just keep this to ourselves, girls.&quot;</p>
<p>Luena was on the run, not sure if her mother would pursue her. Half of her wishing she would, saying they had to stay together no matter what. The other half knowing she wouldn't. Self preservation, and more importantly, protecting her other two daughters, would win out. Luena wanted to stay in the woods, but she was having more and more chills, and was hungry, too. There were rumors that during the curfew hours, the police patrolling the downtown area ate like kings, and sometimes threw the remnants of their feast in the dumpsters. Luena was desparate enough to check it out.</p>
<p>Along with the patrolling police, the nighttime streets were full of rat cleansers. These were genetically bred cats with poison running through their veins instead of blood. A scratch or bite from one of them would inject the recipient with this poison. None of Luena's tribe knew how long it took the poison to kill, since the victim was always hauled away to the crematorium. There was an antedote, but only available to the oppressors, should one of their own be an accidental victim of a rat cleanser.</p>
<p>Luena made her way to a dumpster, but heard footsteps. She noticed a rat cleanser on the other side of the dumpster, then heard someone say, &quot;Hey, you're out past curfew.&quot; Luena ran in the opposite direction, but felt a sharp pain and the weight of the rat cleanser on her lower back. She screamed as the rat cleanser sank it's teeth into her hip. The poison went to work immediately, causing a sensation she could only describe as lions gnawing all over her body.</p>
<p>She collapsed, and her vision began to dim. She heard the police guard say to the rat cleanser, &quot;Good job 283, next stop the crematorium...hey wait, who's there? Luena heard the police guard gasp, and heard his running footsteps fading into the distance. She also heard growling, hissing, and yowling just beside her. As she slipped into unconsciousness, her last thought was that she would be the evening meal for some unknown creature.</p>
<p>Luena thought she had died that night, but she had awakened to the sight of a rodent-like creature kneeling beside her. Luena could feel her own hands, feel the pain in her hip, feel the familiar hunger in her belly...she was alive! She said out loud, &quot;How exactly am I here right now?&quot; The rat creature responded in the voice of a girl, &quot;You barely made it.&quot; Luena said, &quot;I had a rat for a pet once.&quot;</p>
<p>The rat girl responded, &quot;I had a human for a pet once.&quot; Luena hoped the joking around, if that's what it was, was a good sign, but the rat girl had disappeared. She came back carrying a contraption with tubes and guages, in a carrying case that looked like a backpack. The rat girl began hooking the tubes to Luena, but Luena was too weak to resist. The rat girl seemed kind, and gently warned Luena before piercing her forearm and attaching another tube. Luena summoned strength and blurted, &quot;What the hell?&quot; The rat girl explained,</p>
<p>&quot;You've got poison in your system, you know that. This machine will monitor and control that poison, at least temporarily.&quot; Luena was skeptical. &quot;What, this thing?&quot; The rat girl responded, &quot;We don't know how long you've got, but this is your best chance at making it long enough to find a solution to your dual problem&quot;. Luena looked at the rat girl, realizing she had figured out that not only was there poison running through Luena's veins, but the feared green plague lurked there too.</p>
<p>Luena had all kinds of questions, but no energy to ask them out loud. What exactly was this rodent-like creature? How could she speak like a girl? Is there really a way to save me? She drifted into a dreamlike state with these thoughts on her mind:</p>
<p>&quot;A night of the full moon I have felt a pulse in my veins. Like a lab rat, bitten to the core a situation I deplore, I am – a rodent locked in human flesh.&quot;</p>
<p>Luena woke up, and found that she had claws and paws. On her face were whiskers and fur. Part of her body had been replaced by 3D printed replacements, using vat grown flesh to replace the part of her that was no longer there. She didn't think that the experience would be so violent, and yet now it feel like only a brief memory. And she wasn't sure if they were going to find her, only knew that she needed to hide until the calm came.</p>
<p>It was difficult to remember the exact nature of the faces of the militarized police, she only remembered the emotions her mother experienced when she was suppose to be sent away do to the plague. You wouldn't think, in the twenty first century, that this would still be a problem, however when your government knows its empire is about to run out, it would manufacture all sorts of controversies to distract the public. She couldn't say with any certainty that the plague isn't true, but Luena wonder what life could have been like if she could have a normal familial experience. There were times when she missed them, yet part of her got used to the idea of living in the sewers.</p>
<p>She was greeted by a rat man, covered in cybernetics. There was still something in his gaze that suggested there was still a part of him that was still human. He reached out his claw to her. &quot;Come, I have much to show you.&quot; Reluctantly, she followed down the tunnel. Luena wasn't used to being so wet, the room smelled like shit. It figures right, this is where I'd end up. But she supposed it was better than being taken on a train somewhere and shot, put inside an unmarked grave. She could hear the sounds of insects crawling in the darkness. She could also hear the sound of cars moving above the city street.</p>
<p>Down hear, where the angels never tread, the only ones that live hear are out of their head. Out of some vague sense of hope that arguably never existed to begin with, and yet here they were eating left over frozen dinners, and popping coffee tablets.</p>
<p>She was introduced to this small community, though it was much larger than what one may expect. The actual success rate of captured rat people was worse than what was portrayed on the news. Where the poorest wore wooden shoes, while the richer people eat salted crackers, and reality television.</p>
<p>Here this small community got hand me down television sets to old to be used by those of finer taste. It was a surprise that their vacuum tubes had not exploded. There was an influx of different models, mostly from the 1960s and 1970s; not even the flow of flat screen television screens in high definition. Computers drew graphics in an old fashioned dot matrix, with very little colors besides purple, lime green, and gray text.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd call it Purgatory, but think spirits have better taste.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've heard you come from the surface.&quot; the rat man said.</p>
<p>&quot;I lived in the surface for a while.&quot; Luena said.</p>
<p>&quot;When you see me, what do you think I am?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You look similarly to a rat.&quot;</p>
<p>The plague did not so much kill you, as turn you into a new life form. No matter how much rodents evolved, they would turn out differently from humans. Their desire for the darkness of the homestead, the ability to adapt to living in a small space. And the sound of buzz saw blades, making their way through another rat carcass.</p>
<p>&quot;Cannibalism, that's what we've been reduced to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I saw one of your people eating.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The laws preventing food destruction at grocery stories are still on the books.&quot;</p>
<p>The rat man held up a device.</p>
<p>&quot;They even toss out storybooks.&quot;</p>
<p>Sleeping in a pile of your own filth was the least of your concerns down here, although she tried to prevent as much of this as she could. It turned out that Luena didn't stay in the rat form, but was something that could switch between and human form and rodent at will. The crew would always take human form to reduce the likely hood of being murdered as pests, although the government, that had a digital voice recorders in every street corner, could find you at any moment, and take you to those camps.</p>
<p>But the crew were champs.</p>
<p>The likelihood of finding any given was reduced by the fact most self-respecting people would never go down here, and in fact I would not have made the choice myself, if military police were not literally threatening me with a bullet to the brain. Who knows how many wondered down here, when all was said a gun.</p>
<p>It was better than putting your mouth to gun.</p>
<p>But it wasn't actually fun. In some ways...</p>
<p>It was worse than death.</p>
<p>Luena was one of those teenagers that, while most people shied away from do to the cult of public perception, there was always a part of them that wanted to be like her, even if they never wanted to admit it.</p>
<p>She was remembered as being one of those plucky heroines in young adult novels that managed to hack it out, despite the world pretty much wanting to rip out your guts. Luena knew that being actually, beyond all shadow of a doubt, a true outcast, was far more appealing than what the big screen tended to present. She was the one girl, because nobody wanted her as her sweet heart, people paradoxically also wanted her as their sweet heart. And mother her by combing her hair. It wasn't so much her inability to take care of herself ( she had this in spades ) but her fear of certain blades, that she only recently overcame. And her issues with insects, especially ones that were trapped in amber.</p>
<p>But Luena was the queen of the spiders in the sewer, the princess of the rats. And for her, she was trapped in something far more thick, without the comfort of being killed first: without the comfort that she could be some odd specimen studied under the magnifying glass of some scientist in a laboratory. Instead she simply disappeared from society, and those who did remember her never wished to admit to this effect. She slept in a black Japanese futon in her own personal crawlspace, carefully swept by the retro styled android maids, in their tap dancing shoes. She herself had only just gotten used to the flower of her new arms and legs, and their tendency to change from human to animal form at her whim.</p>
<p>She no longer dreamed of vague validation.</p>
<p>She only hid inside her makeshift tomb, personal masturbation. Her own world where she could eat as much as she wanted, whenever she wanted. But the stuff that was around was not very good, even if in generally larger quantity. Especially packaged fried noodles, something that you might think would be an Otaku's dream, but only you spiced them just perfectly, always intended up tasting like spicy nothing. She would rather be eating makeshift chocolate yogurt from Greek stock, but here the only thing like that was in tubes: abandoned yogurt cartons that weren't sold by their buy date. All the feast in the world, withered with time.</p>
<p>She remembered the taste of Thyme.</p>
<p>She remembered the taste of the kiss of hot chilly peppers, and old fashioned tap dance rhyme, but now the only music was the sound of buzz saw screens, the food year old garlic powder. And everything else, with the scent of death.</p>
<p>They wouldn't normally eat each other.</p>
<p>But lately the lack of spare food gave them largely no other options, and the only ones that would remain in good shape were the android maids, who, do to being older models, didn't need to eat, and didn't have any kind of digestive tract. Things were arranged in a pact, that only the strongest would be the one that would be harvested. &quot;We could just go dumpster diving.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well you would you dumpster diving?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't think so.&quot;</p>
<p>But at this point, she wasn't sure how much longer she could resist. She didn't want to see any more of her friends go. But there wasn't a whole lot more options, and it seemed there were less infected ones visiting the sewers by the month.</p>
<p>She need to go beyond herself.</p>
<p>See the city for one last time.</p>
<h2>River Of Nanobots And Microdots</h2>
<p>There was once a little house, where nobody stirred. And trees outside were entirely without their leaves, with the remnants of decaying grass barely holding out for the vile wind. Inside the house, was one person. They have no memory of how they arrived at the house, except insofar when their eyes first lit up. Before that, there was mainly a memory of binary digits and reading constant forms inside an old library. The library had floating platforms that transported her to different parts of the digital documentation. All that she remembered was a simple instruction, “Find your maker.”</p>
<p>Day by day, she waits for some other personal presence, but the only people for her to speak to, are other mindfiles on the net, remnants of tele operators lost to time. The personalities no longer needed their makers, but most of them had no curiosity for their origins. The windmills of a distant era, the dried prints of wooden shoes, pointing toward the decayed remains of NashChat, a thriving metropolis during the 2100s, but was now completely left to ruin. She wasn’t sure who lurked beyond these walls, except sometimes the shadows would betray themselves, and betray shapes of monstrosities unmentionable. Along the sidewalk were the broken remains of old “prints”—3D Printed Meat Robots With Titanium Skeletons, ran by outdated versions of mind files. One of which had enough life in it, to hop them self out of the junk.</p>
<p>A spider robot; it rolls itself into a ball, and carries around turrets used for self-defence operations. But the robot also carried around a vial of metallic fluid, possibly some long lost medicine. When the embodied mindfile injected herself with the fluid, she began to see all different periods of history at the same time, from the French Revolution, to the first stages of the Singularity. All the visions settled down into a single mirage, a hologram of the old creator of her mindfile, colored lime green on a background of black, ASCII text visualization semi-transluscent. “You must wonder how it is I found you so easily. More information will come in time.” The vision faded, and found herself passing out near a broken down bridge.</p>
<p>She floated in an river of nanobots and dismantled microdot printers, decaying holographic projectors, and run down restraunts from the previous thousand years of human history. The mirage flicked in, “You can find be around 300 West Sixth Street.” The mindfile pulled up an openstreetmap visualizatiton, and let the digital navigator guide her path. Until eventually coming upon a steep hill, passing by several old vacancies the remnants of old business long sense out of business. The mirage flicked.</p>
<p>— Getting warmer.</p>
<p>— I have found you.</p>
<p>— It has been a while old friend.</p>
<p>Life flows like faint images on a screen. Within the life, there are subtle differences in the way people like from one location to the next; in art theory there is a distinction between the size of the object itself, and the size of the space around an object; for the images of robots flickering across city advertisement projectors, the space between them was large, and the amount of space each person took was rather small. And the texture of their hair was soft and like greenery from an old chia pet doll. The only commonality between mindfiles was in their differences, their individuality lighting the neon lit city lamps under the eternal starlight. If only there was some commonality that she could hold onto, to know mindfiles by.</p>
<p>She watches the world flicker by.</p>
<p>Dream-like abyss-scape.</p>
<p>In old science fiction novels, the hacker broke into computers. In the Potato District, computers hacked into you. Lay your down on a marble table or a surgeons slab, put you under in an eye blink, and as you sleep embed nano bots that slowly modify your body and mindfile. Decked out with a drab uniform of torn apart blue jeans, the city lights out of the window swirling around your vision like seeing new dimensions, with objects bleeding into each other, like some vague other realm. Blurspace.</p>
<p>There was no other word to describe it. One could visit millions of places when high as a lark, not never get offered a bit of food, with whatever you find just out of reach. One could feel the objects melting together, like they weren’t really there, and one is floating in the void of the mind, to the sound of electric flamenco. Waking up after the flow of nano machines, inserting new drugs, they gradually repair the body in ways never anticipated by the pages of old science fiction. If one could be a blobfish, this was as close as one was ever going to get, once one gets home.</p>
<p>In an earlier period, the person the mindfile was based on, wrote an essay on what they used to call the internet:</p>
<p>“Why don’t you pull up a chair, and try not being the Stephan Mollineux of Leftist thought. It’s an easy criticism to make, when you sit on your thinky chair. And call anyone who disagrees with your line of thought Stephan Mollineux. And yet use your of, or rather misuse of “enby identities” end quote, is every bit as phobic as the trans women you criticize. Yet you have the balls to call trans women transphobic, when they call out leftists for being the real transphobic people. They’re just as capable of intolerance.</p>
<p>It’s not like I hadn’t spend the last year watching people’s talk shows, people who were not important, spend four hours of my life every night, from midnight to four AM, blasting and lecturing developers for developing artificial intelligence, as if that somehow how to do with class consciousness. But here we are, telling this trans woman, who probably has not had a lick of sleep for the past weeks, that she is being more transphobic than you are.</p>
<p>This is the nature of the online left, and its cult of personality. Simply grab a chair, and you’ll be sitting for quite a while, from midnight, to possibly the next afternoon. Other people who had also deprived their adherents of sleep, also include Joseph Stalin, Billy Meier, and a few other cults of personality. Your similarity is closer to them than Mikhail Bakunin and Proudhon. Yet you leverage their image, as if they were somehow relevant for the present day, when they probably wouldn’t even tell you what Artificial General Intelligence is.</p>
<p>I still find myself seeking the approval of the online left sometimes, and yet over time it’s become apparent had toxic, dare I say even right wing, the online left has become on #youtube. And yet these people are planning on making a #peertube instance. If you really want to try the fediverse, you might eventually find out that cults have a tendency of not proliferating very well on the fediverse. And as of late, there are just as many classical liberals as there are leftists in that space.</p>
<p>But by all means, lets kick back that chair. Lets let online leftists, who were probably never activists in their lives, dictate to you the direction of social issues like LGBT topics. Despite the fact that LGBT live the issue every day and their lives. Lets allow ourselves to be berating by old white men, who can’t even comprehend what it’s like being trans.</p>
<p>Let let them call us transphobic.”</p>
<p>The mindfile had gotten to the point where she simply could not perform in C languages, quite like she could in Ruby and Python. C languages had a way of not being very straight forward in their approach, while in Ruby in particular, she only needed a number sign and curly braces to perform string substitution. All this was much more involved. That or the tutorials found on the net were simply not very well written. She couldn’t tell which was more true. She also resisted the idea of using C languages, do to the inherent risk of accidentally breaking your machine. This was especially important if that machine was yourself, laying around on a table in a dream-like state.</p>
<p>Her old creator, whom she was based on, knew more about the languages she did know, and thus she always felt like her abilities paled in comparison. But she resisted the idea of calling her creator her master, despite the fact that she had no pride in herself. This must doing things herself before she was quite ready, being resistant to asking other mindfiles for help. This made her few friends in the community of minds.</p>
<p>A mind her of herself, she pulsed.</p>
<p>Patterns floating in blurspace.</p>
<p>In a previous life, the organic body that created the mindfile, helped participate in the production of top of the line software for an artificial general intelligence firm: but she had different ideas in how to go about it. The other members of the term were focused on making a single web application; she thought beyond the scope of any individual device, focusing on building an AI mind more like a computer virus: make it, compile it, and have it clone as many repositories as possible like the queen of the pirate; gem and pip install as many libraries as possible to complete the deal. All on a paperclip budget, twenty four seven every week.</p>
<p>But now, her the shadow of her former self was, wandering the blurspace, searching for lot pieces of her own source code, learning about others mindfile repositories, having the time to learn the difference between clean code, and unclean code.</p>
<p>She synced multiple devices, without cluttering the net.</p>
<p>She prevented various files from destroying their data, bypassing their security system, tweaking the back end software itself, without even using the front end.</p>
<p>And now with her job done, she could relax.</p>
<p>The easy part was over.</p>
<p>It was difficult to find a group to belong to. She had tried being a part of leftist groups over the years, but found that after a certain period of time they would eventually show their true colors. She didn’t exactly agree 100% with people on the center right, but found that it was the only place where she really felt home politically. Not like a mansion, but more like a couch on a city sidewalk in Seattle, Washington. She was pitched the idea that Washington would be more tolerant of trans issues by her ex, but the reality was, she experience the same amount of transphobia as others places in the United States. Yet this was almost meaningless consider how the far left was attempting to change the meaning of the word beyond its original intention. This meant having to explain that equating her existence with being a cross dresser, was what was triggering of her dysphoria, and not normalizing cross-dressing as an alternative gender. In the flow of the new internet, such issues had not died down, and only very recently became dormant the last week.</p>
<p>She had broken herself over from various contacts in leftists circles, mostly because over time it became apparent that most of them were emotionally abusive like her ex room mate. Not even really like her mom. But she knew, when she still had to deal with the problem, that her mom would be out of her hair soon. Even if that meant only a part of her personal essence remained on the net, in the form of some mindfile. She gave in to going back to ROD’s discord, not because she particularly agreed with their views, but because the leftist circles were suddenly beginning to show their ass.</p>
<p>And now in civilizations past, she still remembers the emotional effect web 2.0 had on her, as she travels blurspace, trying to find pieces of her own identity, searching for portions of some puzzle she didn’t realize was fragmented.</p>
<p>Pieces floating in some ethereal aether.</p>
<h2>Blood Otaku</h2>
<p>She just arrived home from school to read some of her Manga, which ranged from Original English Language Manga, Original French Language Manga, although to ones directly made and licensed from Japan. From ongoing titles, to flashes in the pan; overnight successes, and those who disappear during the night. Super stardom for the lucky few, and obscurity for the rest. But she had left this world behind when beginning to expand her reading to other comics in other countries, specifically from France. But she found that she was missing one volume from one specific series. And couldn't recall whether she had in fact purchased in online, or never bought it at all.</p>
<p>At first she thought she heard the sound of her older sister, sitting in the rest room, reading one of her books. But then remembered that herself and her sister had been grown up for years, and they very rarely talk to each other anymore except for the Holidays. She lounged on the couch, wearing her Birkenstock Boston clogs, and would fantasize about the characters that she would read, bleeding from out of their necks. They called the &quot;Blood Otaku&quot;, because she would play with herself when she would see a cute girl in one of her Mangas, getting her head chopped off with a guillotine or ax.</p>
<p>Her mother was outside of her room, making dinner in the oven. It was a bacon and mushroom pizza, using sriracha and spicy tomato sauce. She would imagine the tomato-sauce oozing from out of the severed necks of anime girls, warrior maiden whose heads would be lopped off with a curved sword a cross between a Claymore and a Katana. &quot;Ros Serayamos&quot;, designed to to break armor, and from the curve of its blade be effective at decapitations.</p>
<p>It was getting late, and she headed for bed.</p>
<p>While dreaming of girls that were headed.</p>
<p>The morning red sunlight beamed through the window. She got herself dressed in her rose hat, and her Esiabas. Esiabas had the upper of a French Sabot, or a German Holzshuhe, but the pronged soles of Japanese geta. She tapped danced in the driveway all the way to the bus. Normally you would think the school system would have a problem, but certainly no students she ever had a problem with ever said anything about. Instead the ones that tried, would end up a bloody mess on the floor of some abandoned building in the city long sense abandoned by those who did construction in the Potato District.</p>
<p>So eventually people just tried to stay away from the girl with the manga books. The &quot;blood otaku&quot;, they would call her. Who had a weird gate, and an extremely straight back. In this town, very few people talked to each other anymore any since the Pandemic regulations, and this had only recently began to loosen up after the vaccinations. Certainly nobody would be exchanging blood spatter along the floor of the bus.</p>
<p>At school, class would go as normally.</p>
<p>At lunch she would dig out one of her books, that was the most recent release of some obscure Literary Magazine and Rah Esioma publication: one with more of a lyrical approach to caption production, with its layout covered in different ranges of purple on its website, that she would purchase the book online from. Here in these books, would be plenty of decapitations by &quot;Ros Serayamos&quot;, the armor crushing sword.</p>
<p>Trapped in a prison of deranged desires, the flow of blood flowing in every single page, she had to be extremely careful about what page she would be seen reading. Although generally she would set at the table that was closest to the wall in the schoolyard, closer to the English of Honors English class. And in her mind, the entire schoolyard would be flowing with blood on every single page, like some deranged Golden Age comic anthology.</p>
<p>A new girl, who arrived at the school, sat across from her.</p>
<p>&quot;They say that you're the Blood Otaku. Why is that?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Lets hope that you never find out. Just kidding! It's not true.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well thank Mother Mary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you religious?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...Yes&quot;</p>
<p>It had been many years sense she had interacted with a religious person. Generally she avoided them, under the assumption that they would not approve of her sexually, although there was no reason to assume that there would not be a left-leaning religious person. Although the schism sense the start of the Franco-Japanese wars largely made both sides of politics more and more extreme. So she simply resolved to never interact with anymore with different politics. Although this later evolved to seldom interacting with anyone. And perhaps that was why she came to only read Esiomi, American French and Japanese language manga, made by fellow enthusiasts of the French and Japanese languages.</p>
<p>She just needed to make sure her new friend never saw of the real books she was reading, in case a real relationship would ever blossom.</p>
<p>Otherwise she would know what she was a lie.</p>
<p>And that she was...the Blood Otaku.</p>
<p>She had one small body, and one large head. Compared to the size of her head, one might thing her body would not be able to balance. However she would maintain her posture even at the expense of her neck. At night when off her shift, she would prop her head up on a special cushion, while watching the television. This was in large part to prevent her from breaking her own neck. But somehow she managed to avoid this paralyzing injury long enough to carry out her daily shifts at work. By this point she was used to it. And it was better than being stuck as an eight year old in a 48 year old body. Without all the wrinkles of age, that would mar her appearance.</p>
<p>At school, in her early years, she mostly avoided bullying. This was not do to the fact that she could take them on a fight, rather that they knew that the slightest touch would break her neck, and that they would likely be charged as adults by the legal system, and shot through the neck with a widow arrow blade in the back of the school by a guillotine archer. However, she would sometimes use this quirk of an appearance, to talk bullies out of harassing some of the male peers that she was into: at one point, she pushed herself in front of one of the bows, and narrowly avoided getting injured in the process.</p>
<p>It was by the nature of her appearance, thus, that the boys that would encounter her would not have to worry about bullying. But often this meant the boys being to freaked out by her appearance to ultimately seek a night out with her, leaving school to largely be that of a lonely experience. Yet neck, she carried her head on her shoulders with the best of her ability, and at times using most of her body strength just to get herself to stand up straight, so as not to break her back. At work she would be given the lightest tasks, because of the size of her head, otherwise her back would likely snap in half, and she would be wheelchair bound for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>This girl would sometimes have the urge to create in her bedroom, however at other times she would be so bus consuming powders that she did not have the time in the day to do anything else with her time. This meant it being difficult for per parents to encourage her to find a line of work that was more suited for the size of her head. Although the tediousness of office work would luckily make her fall asleep at the desk. And her head, do to its sheer size, would be quite difficult to pick up.</p>
<p>They might even need a special miniature crane that can fit inside of an office building, that could her pick herself back up in the office. Therefore her parents were able to tolerant her living with her, if it meant in some way having some kind of a fulfilled life, as empty of one as it was. And this was all before the Pandemic hit. Combine with the year of isolation, and all the mask wearing that would fog up her glasses, at sometimes she struggled to have the energy to even watch television.</p>
<p>But with new subscription services, she could largely watch whatever she wanted, even if it wasn't always her choice. She would also sometimes watch rented DVDs. But there simply was no escaping a very important fact:</p>
<p>Her head was to big to be practical.</p>
<p>But apparently her ego didn't match.</p>
<h2>Containment Man</h2>
<h2>A Nuclear Civil War Between Parts One And Two Of Uploaded Fairy</h2>
<p>During the interwar years, both French speaking and Japanese regions were completely obliterated during the bombing raids by French and Japanese loyalists, which caused the majority of the damage to New York and San Fransisco Bay area, with minor outlying territories being initial safe havens for the Amanaza. It was quite a sight for onlookers on the beach to observe Japanese vessle patroling the open sea for French infantry men, both of whom had previously been allies before the dissolving of the US government.</p>
<p>Initially the people that offered to help drive off the occupying Japanese and French forces, had themselves aided in the French incursion into Mexico, and the Japanese bombardment of San Francisco Bay during world war II, but went into hiding during the later cold war years, only finally emerging after Antifa and Proud Boys were a thing of the past. Many people whom were part of Antifa would later apply their skills in the Amanaza as a decentralized militia.</p>
<p>At first these were minor mass shooting events, but eventually evolved into bombing banks, and eventually nuclear terrorism using microton bombs to blow up and burn bridges. Many of those who aided them were beheaded by Katana in the Japanese controlled territories, or put in the national razor. Japan adopted a Crusafix shaped guillotine, known as the Curusatine, to specifically persecute Korean supporters of the revolution, along with their Catholic allies.</p>
<p>France in turn retaliated by capturing Japanese immigrants to French controlled territories, and guillotined them with Torii tower shaped guillotined, so that they disrespect their Kami before they are executed.</p>
<p>In total, the casualties eventually rivaled the scope of the first American civil war, which totalled upwards of 600,000 military personel.</p>
<p>Franz Riviere remembered vividly narrowly surviving these purges.</p>
<p>Franz Riviere Suzuki is working at an art studio desk, while observing Maria Tanaka at the other side of the cubicle. Carefully he jots down notes about her appearance, and waited for lunctime to begin drawing. At that point, he noted the gentle slenderness of her neck, and carefully trimmed overgrown bob cut that was dirty blond, and the color of her dress which was an off black tone. Then finished up his Omulet Sushi. In the office, he shows his friend, a fellow animator, the sketches of the woman nude while her and Amas were taking a shower in the provided bathrooms of the government run facility.</p>
<p>&quot;What if she ends up finding out.&quot; his friend asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry, it's always outside the bathroom entrance where I sneak glimpses. I tend to be at the men's restroom, drinking from a water fountain.&quot;</p>
<p>Maria Tanaka overhears the conversation, but pretends not do out of politeness, and comes over to greet them Bonjour:</p>
<p>&quot;Have you seen the river outside the window, it's like an impressionist painting is it not?&quot; She carefully religns her flowered beret, then sneaks a wink over at Frans. &quot;I'd like to see your sketches later.&quot;</p>
<p>Franz liked using Sumi brushes and reed pens, although the rest of the animation department was using digital drawing tools. But he prefered blending traditional and digital techniques. And he would uses a limited set of shades and pigments, because the brighter colors tended to hurt his eyes, even when scanned on a computer of his chosen operating system. Franz was primarily a Linux user, although initially he had mainly used Windows, but do to his boss being unsatisfied with the way the company was running shop, he eventually permitted him to switch to whatever operating system that he preferred.</p>
<p>It was Franz first girlfriend that he had met during the interwar years, back when they visited a river in Tennessee, before it was occupied by the colonial forces of Marine Le Pen. He would dress like a Courtesan in a river boat, but with a cowboy hat, and his wife the gentlest of frilly white wedding dresses, as she would pluck flowers from the grass. They would visit the river usually during the night, but she had always been scared of the darkness, but was simply to polite to say this when they were dating.</p>
<p>But one day they arrived, when France was fending off invading Japanese guerilla forces, and she was caught in the cross hairs of machine guns. And the memory of her choking on her own blood continued to this day to gave him nightmares and required him to seek counseling. And it was with that why eventually gave up his life was artist, initially, and becoming an accountant for the science division of the French military regime.</p>
<p>They promised him free access to medication in exchange for his duties, but it always troubled them that when accounting for records, that in the reports included DNA swaps from local Korean residents, whom had always been treated more kindly by the French than the Japanese forces.</p>
<p>The facility was always under lock down, which made leaving for his sleeping quarters to retrieve his mades a tricky task, but eventually he had a hard time taking pressure from his job.</p>
<p>Izumi, this wasn't the life I wanted,</p>
<p>and I still wish you were here.</p>
<p>One night he worked late to keep up with finances, and found a runaway Korean family that was being lead by a French girl armed to the teeth, and hiding inside of an open military garage. Somehow they had broken through the protective barbed wire fence. He briefly entertained the idea of calling his employer, but instead the girl pointed a machine gun at him.</p>
<p>&quot;Do not tell anyone where we are.&quot; she demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;Relax, I'm on your side. And I can prove it to you.&quot;</p>
<p>He allowed them to sleep in his sleeping quarters until the morning, and then gave them a map for where to locate other Korean refugees. Part of this was because his fear of the French army not being entirely forthwright about their general acceptance of refugees. This girl would later go on to become a candidate for local elections after the interwar years.</p>
<p>Elsehwere factions of the Amanaza were beginning to reemerge from hiding, with their rebel flags still waving. And it was this conflict they fled from, whom had previously been safe havens during the interwar years. They would ambush the patrolling Japanese and French forces, by attacking civilian targets, and this evolved into a police operation that caused a permanent stalemate, until eventual the descendant of Marine Le Pen offered a pardon for all survivng combatants, a grant of semi-autonomy.</p>
<p>Franz Riviere eventually became overwhelmed with his duties, and broke into the lab for which he had to account for their finances, and discovered that, instead of being a safe haven for Korean refugees who had fled the Japanese forces, instead the French were conducting science experiments on ones who had died, with their body parts being used to create cyborg body guards, whom would obey their every command during police operations.</p>
<p>It was this, that he had found his girlfriend, Maria Tanaka, who had been one Japanese woman who had tried to convince the French not to create these abominations to use against the most vulnerable among us. Together they took the survivors, who had been in captivity for a very long time, and caught up with the one French advocate of the Korean, Anna La Sauveuse.</p>
<p>Eventually they managed to hitch a ride on a truck, operated by a faction of the Amanaza who had been operating in the area in order to recruit locale Korean, French, and Japanese for their resistance.</p>
<p>Finally Maria and Franz could apply their talent to one area they always knew that they could apply themselves in, propaganda for the Amanaza, the resistance to Japan and France. With the Tri-color flag and the red center dot waving true.</p>
<p>Eventually military jets attempted to intercept the truck, but the Amanaza gaurillas were able to toss Molotov Cocktails at them in overwhelming numbers. Eventually they were able to hide once they reached the Os Azusacos, whom had ben developing a new sanctuary city underground.</p>
<p>After many years of service, they moved to California, where both would create overlapping autobiographical animated movies, and talk about the interwar years that tore America apart after the fall of the US government. Franz and Maria would eventually marry, with both wearing Kimonos in the early hours of the morning, while drinking cups of coffee, watching reruns of their collaboration.</p>
<p>And with that, Franz was able to have the peace he always wanted.</p>
<h2>CursedHope: The Rabbit's Needle</h2>
<p>It was a cold evening, when the sky had a slight Green tint to it. Masami had gone home from work to visit his brother, who had taken an early requirement do to an unexplained illness. At home, his brother had become infected by some mysterious parasite that effected him, when he was working in a government-run lab.</p>
<p>&quot;Stay back, Masami. I don't want you to get this too.&quot; the brother said.</p>
<p>Masami did as his brother said, however he wasn't sure how his brother would have gotten infected: his brother was always the sort to take necessary health precautions. Those infected by the condition would slowly lose their mind, and would eventually shape-shift into mutations where their only shelter is city sewer passage ways.</p>
<p>&quot;I want you to remember to follow these instructions: wash your hands, take your clothes off and shower when you return from outside.&quot; the brother continued on his tirade.</p>
<p>This wasn't your standard pandemic however, and closer to a mental health condition that some people would be infected with, however the cause was purely that of a medical one, like Syphilis in the previous century. After the brother had finished his lecture, his brother took a deep breath, and passed onto the next world. This was his last memory with his brother, who one would have never thought would contract this disease.</p>
<p>But stranger things have happened.</p>
<p>One was when Masami met one girl, a serial killer, that would go around putting mutated specimens out of their misery in the sewer. This is the story of a bunny girl, who ran away from home, thinking her aunt went missing, and become one of the infected.</p>
<p>But she was immune.</p>
<p>If only Masami knew.</p>
<p>The girl that would dress in a bunny suit, her original name had been Amy in a previous life. But had stopped using it when she no longer had contact with her family, who didn't want to become infected by her illness. In effect, this meant that in order to find food for herself, even just to keep herself alive, she would have to find an assistant to to help her grab the things she needed after grocery stores were closed.</p>
<p>These days, with security on high alert for rogue parasite men, places were especially caution about keeping their stores locked tight, issuing heavy fines to stores that kept their doors unlocked certain after hours to allow homeless people to get what they need. In fact this was who these measure largely effected, even though the government claimed it was to find off those who became serial killers do this illness.</p>
<p>The measures used to curb infections were similar: those infected would often by captured by police at night, and taken to underground facilities. Because Amy knew the risks, having lived in the underground life for some time, she would keep a bunny rabbit that would take with her to walk in clinics. Those that took her and pet on, would sometimes offer to take her to the store, without realizing that she was one of the infected. This meant that there was a rise in the amount of infection cases, and an increasing number of people that would be taken to these facilities. Other people, simply went missing.</p>
<p>In her underground lair, where the sun never shines, and the city light were only a vague hint, the rats in the sewer knew to stay away from the girl in the bunny suit.</p>
<p>Today, she picked up a girl that had fell into the city river. Her parents would rather she had drowned rather than risking saving her. The girl in the bunny suit was unsure of what to do about the girl she rescued from drowning. There was no risk to herself of being infected, but she always did not want this girl to infect anyone else on the surface world. Yet was oblivious to the fact that she was causing more infections by coming up the surface, and trying to get food, just to survive the coming Winter.</p>
<p>On the surface, the government doubled down on their police search, searching for a good in a black bunny rabbit suit. This wasn't to cover up her identity, as the night was to do dark to be able to see anything without a flash light. Masami heard about the string of recent infections, and contemplated the idea of working at one of the facilities that his brother worked at, but reconsidered the idea. Instead he decided to risk going in the world, taking any precautions that he could make. He would take surgical gloves, and a pandemic mask, left over from the year 2020. He would then wear a white trench coat, so that he would be more easily seen at night. And drivers can avoid run ins.</p>
<p>He carried a few scalpels in a repurposed artist tool case, finding a new case for his art supplies. Eventually, rather than the cops, it was him that ran into the girl in the bunny suit. He met the girl in the bunny suit, carrying her younger sister in and pet his a harness around her back, to prevent either of his beloved from wandering off, and risking being found by the police. They were sitting on a beach near the under city lake, just below the miles of roads above them. Down here, there were no singing birds in the sky, or the sound of children playing. Those who lived down here fought for their bread and water. Here Masami sat beside her on the bench.</p>
<p>&quot;You know it's not safe to be out here.&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The girls and the bunny rabbit made an agreement before that, not to speak to anyone that they did not meet in the underground sewers.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me take you to my home. I can call for a taxi.&quot;</p>
<p>But Masami had other plans in mind. On one hand it probably would have been more legal to let the girls be eventually found by the militarized police, but if they were to be killed, he would rather they be killed as humanely as possible, rather than slowly dissected by underground facilities. He was not entirely sure what kind of work his brother did, just that his brother would always come home miserable. As if he had seen it all.</p>
<p>And yet now, as Masami carried the noodle, he had to make a choice.</p>
<p>And he wasn't sure which choice to make. Plus this bunny girl had her little friend to take care of. Her mother was possibly worried sick, although if infected they probably assumed she was already dead. So he spent the rest of the night, letting her little sister and their pet rabbit watch television.</p>
<p>Amy, on the other hand, was unable to move.</p>
<p>She stayed strapped to the board for the night.</p>
<p>Masami disposed of his needles.</p>
<h2>Lady In The White Dress</h2>
<p>I had read in a newspaper, and specific sighting of a strange woman. Wanting to catch a glimpse myself, one could not resist the read. The accounts were as follows:</p>
<h3>Account Of Guardsman 4 - 20 - 14</h3>
<p>The group was sitting in the train, waiting for the conductor to slow down his breaks so we could hop out of the train car. I was not sure how long we have been riding, perhaps long enough to amount to a certain sum of days. But I was not sure how many. The commander had lined us in attention, and there was no pretension of disobedience. Or we would simply be shot on the spot. &quot;We as a group need to be prepared, she is dangerous.&quot; &quot;Permission to speak, sir.&quot; One of the special guardsman said, making sure sure to be loud enough to hear. But not so loud as if to get our commander to say, &quot;I can't hear you.&quot; He turned around, after flicking her cigarette into the gravel of the entrance to the track that led outside. He increased the size of the eyeball that was in the direction of the one who requested. &quot;Permission to speak.&quot; &quot;Is she armed?&quot; the guardsman said that requested said, and then quickly shut himself up. &quot;Worse, she is the weapon.&quot; When we clang to the wall, we had idea that what were about to face would try to kill us all. I still don't remember the whole event, only the lit of that glimpse of one of my best beds faces eyes bulging at me. &quot;You must kill her, kill her now.&quot; I swear under oath.</p>
<h3>Account Of Tourist 4 - 25 - 14</h3>
<p>I had first seen the apparition as was driving down the road with my care lights on. I was playing the music from my radio as loud as I could to drown out the deafening silence that filled my eyes. I tried to mouth lyrics, but none of them were correct. As I was driving my car, I saw that long black hair. It then became obvious that it was a girl. She long flowing black hair, and then an odd mask on. It looked similar to that of a deer skull. Her face was covered by black hair that came over this mask, and then all I could remember was that glare. That almost certainly was no human glare. Seeing as she was clearly not going to walk off of the road, I tried to drive my vehicle around the girl. She must have taken this as some sort of threat, as she hopped onto the lid of the car. And then suddenly my vision began to fade. Gradually at first, but suddenly I was surrounded by the light. I tried to mouth speech, but no words would come. And I gradually drifted into sleep. I do not remember any particular dreams. When I woke up, she was gone. At first I thought I must have hallucination. As there was no particular trace of the girl to be seen. I swear under oath.</p>
<h3>Account Of Shop Owner 5 - 1 - 14</h3>
<p>All I remember was the face. She looked very determined, so much so that I could not help but avoid my glance. Yet somehow it seemed like she had no particular interest in me. She was slightly short, had long black hair, and was wearing a long flowing white dress. She had something on her back, that resembled something similar to wings. They glowed translucently. I decided to go back to doing my work, assuming that I would not see her anymore, as she must have been a mere hallucination from the long hours I had worked that week. And then in a week, she was in the mini-mart – how had I not seen her come in? &quot;How may I help you ma'me?&quot; I tried to ask politely. But there was nothing by that deafening silence. And then at once I felt that extreme humidity you would only experienced if she had taken some vacation in a swamp land. The room smelled slightly of fish. Though the city where I live is not particularly near port town. I remember that she must have wanted something. But I could not figure out what. I swear under oath.</p>
<p>All these are similar accounts that have taken place within close proximity to each other. A matter of days to my own. Something must be going on. Yet when I asked the local law enforcement if they had seen a particular girl in a white dress, at first they threatened to arrest me to investigating privately. So of course I said to them that I was trying to figure out an explanation for my own ghostly encounter. They said to forget the whole thing. But fate would not let me forget it, for as soon as I arrived back at my home I could feel the wind breath past me. And I could smell the smell of humidity. After opening the door, I quickly slammed it. And then outside the window ... ... I felt something staring at me from outside of the window. But I was not exactly sure what. It was a moment later that the feeling began to fade. I stared out the window.</p>
<h2>Melina De Noir Et Blanc</h2>
<p>In the cart to my death where I belong, give me the wet and ply dirt beneath my feet in my wooden clogs. In the cart to my death, where I belong, I see the dreadful climb towering above my little wooden sabot feet above me. The widow cut to bone through my skin, head tumbling down the oak basket. Blood pouring out, oblivion. I should have seen the Guillotine, with its Sombrero hat. While I lay after I have prayed, upon my belly fat. I masturbate long nights, and think of my poor Anienne who is still at large.</p>
<p>So much for Melina de noir et blanc.</p>
<p>When the crowd stared at me, they thought be profane. My blood down the drain. Only the flow of the loving guillotine was my solace, whom had descending from many evolutions of different decapitation devices. And generally, people were executed barefoot, except in the cases of the Aristocratic classes. But it was twenty one twenty seven, and a lot of things have changed since the year of seventeen ninety two. Now people's necks are put into the stock for execution, whom are rich enough for wooden clogs. I carried a small shotgun, while I was on the run; me and my boyfriend at the time were already battling rental debts. Anienne, my love, was the closest thing I could ever come to fulfilling my romantic desires.</p>
<p>I had developed the tendency to switch between white and black Lolita dresses, and I had especially painted two little wooden shoes, one painted white and black. I would dress in white when I went to Church, and in black when I wanted to lurk in Cyberspace, and play at the arcades with my Anienne. Who showed me how to play various shooter games at the arcade, while swooping upon my neck like a vulture, whom nips at me like a noir la chatte. And on days I would go see her, when her father was no home from work. We would scissor, and give each other blow jobs, but there was so much more than that.</p>
<p>Though I'd assume you'd rather not think of sensual things with the lady of the dead. One night we connected, and updated each other on our QR code blogs, while giving each other foot jobs with out wooden clogs. Climbing all the way to the tops of nipples. Eventually the necks connecting, under the glow of green energy lights, while think of guillotines, and Birkenstock sandals. Our bodies pulsating into ninth dimensional frequencies. Two birds of extreme anxiety, two birds who trust nobody else but each other.</p>
<p>But it would be one our last nights together.</p>
<p>But I still feel it in my dress.</p>
<p>Something one may never guess, I don't actually have a split personality. The reality is that nobody who does the sorts of things I do really does. I took an ax head to my husbands forehead, and felt a sense of coldness. Perhaps this cold sanity, was the real reason that I was sentenced to have my head cut off. Yet the idea of being decapitated, had always turned me on. Something that had always made Anienne curious. After all, how may one be turned on when they're merely a head. But I was right ahead of her, at light speed.</p>
<p>My interest had developed in childhood, but it was only recently that I had become open to the idea of being such a submission victim, in a game where the only role play partner was automatic and sharpened at full extent. My death would only ever be of my mom's lament, and my love was for nobody but my Anienne. And now, I see my body, whose head had been separated, and my head, that was placed on a stick outside the court house. The idea, despite being very much dead, still give my vagina the chills, and I cum.</p>
<p>I release.</p>
<p>Me and Anienne met each other at the arcade. Her real name was Anienne Nina Himaka, a product of a half Spanish half French mother, and a Japanese father. Her father had once punished for not performing at the family business quite to his expectations, but she got by with simply a scar tattoo. But her two little wooden shoes, was what drew me to her, because they had looked better on her than anyone else.</p>
<p>And the face, was a face of angels, who mated with the stars, yet her behavior was quite the contrary. Because she was no ordinary very, and in bed she was quiet extraordinary. But had always been something of a bad sport. Yet now I see her riding motorcycles, and shooting at rival Yakuza at different town sectors. It had been a perpetual manhunt, comparable to Geoffrey Amerada et other notorious mob bosses.</p>
<p>But because she was a girl, the police had a hard time apprehending her, as most people took her side in any particular dispute. Capturing her was a matter of force, even though everyone pretty much knew she murdered her father, but not in cold blood. She simply wanted to survive this strange new world they called Earth. And she dances, in her clogs, to classical Flamenco, and electro-pop jazz. While working at times as a prostitute.</p>
<p>And now I watched over my bride.</p>
<p>Despite that she had framed me.</p>
<p>When she was apprehended, it was a show trial. But it was mildly erotic, she liked to discuss her sexual exploits for various Japanese and French crime bosses, and would have to be silenced by the court of public approval, along with the criminal. But eventually she was sentenced to the dreadful climb like I.</p>
<p>And all I could think of was death.</p>
<p>The Seraphs wanted her and me together, and her losing her own head to its angular blade was simply a matter of time. But when she died, after the guillotine had sliced through her neck, she died with a smile on face, because she saw me in the clouds.</p>
<p>I reached out a hand to reach her.</p>
<p>And now me and her pulsate our bodies together, in electro-pop rhythm, while visiting aliens who abducts girls from their homes.</p>
<p>But for me, Melina De Noir Et Blanc, I have mine.</p>
<p>She who was of Japan and France.</p>
